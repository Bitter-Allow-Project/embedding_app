could i please call anna motloung to come forward anna anna
excuse my earlier pronunciation is it motloung is that how you
anna sorry for having inconvenienced you by changing the
programme around but we just felt that given that those three witnesses
were really speaking about a similar incident it would be best for us to
heard them all one after the other rather than interrupt the account
which they were giving so i ask you again to bear with us it’s been a
long day anna you are coming to speak about an event which took place
in in june your son mendi gabrial zulu a very tragic event
i’m sure it’s something that still pains you a lot mr hugh lewin is
going to assist you with your statement but before you relate to us what
happened to gabrial i would ask you please if you would just raise your
right hand to take the oath do you swear that the testimony that which
you will give will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the
mama motloung can you hear me through the headphones 
yes i can hear you thank you
as the chairperson has said this relates to an incident which
took place in june and concerns your son if you could please just
in your own words tell us what happened tell us about your son who he
was and how you saw the whole thing thank you
in on the sixth of june at night when we were asleep
i heard the police knocking just before sun rise i woke up and i opened
the door they asked me where mendi was and i told them that i didn’t
know his whereabouts they went with me in mendi’s room and the door was
locked from outside when they realized that the door was locked they
went into the house came back with an axe and they chopped the door
open the three of them went inside all in all there were six of them
three went inside the house and three were left behind after a few
minutes i don’t know what happened to them afterwards but lindiwe was
inside the house and when they found her inside a gun was fired they
went out with the mattress and they threw it on the ground
we were still waiting outside and an ambulance came to take
him to the hospital on the fifteenth of june they arrived during the
day to inform me that he passed away in the hospital we buried him and
after the police came with a van and picked me up together with lindiwe
and my other sister they took us to the police station in town and they
took a statement from us they said we shouldn’t worry because they will
mrs motloung could i ask for some explanations lindiwe was in
the room with mendi was she 
lindiwe was in the room with mendi so they found her but
at first in your statement you say they did not find him
they found mendi together with lindiwe in the room
in your statement you say that he was under the bed is that
lindiwe was in the house and she saw him and she heard them
said here’s a person under the bed
was there only one shot that you heard 
and they gave no explanation to you at the time what they were
they used to come to my house to search for mendi and when
i asked them why were they looking for him they said he was in
yes it happened several times sometimes they would come
and say mendi fought with a policeman
did you ever see mendi with a firearm 
so as far as you know he never had a firearm
i have never seen him with a gun sir
why do you think they came so often 
do you think it was i see in your statement you say he was a
member of pac was it because of that do you think 
yes he was a member of the pac
was he an activist you say he was also a member of paso does
that mean that he was very active 
what is puzzling is that this is june which was less than
a year before the election the first democratic election so there could
have been nothing illegal that he was doing by being a member of the pac
you must have thought about it a lot why do you think they were after
they were after him because he was fighting the policeman
why particularly why was there this fight at that stage in our
i do not know i was only given the news that he fought
where did you get that new from 
was that after he had died
and lindiwe didn’t give you any indication about what the fight
no she never told me anything i only heard that mendi was
running up and down with a policeman fighting
did you ever discuss it with mendi himself 
i asked him mendi what’s happening to you are you
fighting with the policeman he never told me the truth
he didn’t give any explanation at all 
he never explained anything to me
what was he doing at the time was he still a student i see
you say he was twenty one
what did he intend to do after his schooling after his studies
he hadn’t taken a decision what to do after completing his
so you really have no idea why there was this attack early in
the morning or why they came to collect him you’ve never been able to
after they came on the fifteenth of june after they came to
say that he had died did they bring a death certificate did you ever
i went to look for a death certificate in heidelberg my
brothers went to look for it
can you remember what the death certificate said 
i have a death certificate here with me i’m sorry i can’t
thanks while we’re getting the death certificate could i ask
between the sixth and the fifteenth when they came to tell you did you
try and go to find him or go and see him 
lindiwe and my other daughter and a relative of mine went
on that same day to the hospital
did they get a chance to talk to him before he died 
no he was just quiet he couldn’t say a word
was any policeman ever charged was there a case against the
no there was no case against the police
also in your statement ma motloung you mentioned some specific
names who people who lindiwe said she saw actually shooting him was
there ever a case made against them any charge brought against them 
there was no case because i haven’t heard of a case at all
do you know what’s happened to these policemen now 
i do not know i only learnt later that one of the
policeman shot himself dead because he shot a person earlier on
yes this was another person and after shooting this person
he turned the gun on himself
could your companion just tell us what’s on the death
only the date of death and the place heidelberg
but no cause of death ma motloung is there anything specific
that you’d like us to try and do 
would you like us to try and follow up with the police 
yes you can follow it up but i’ve lost hope because the
policeman i’ve referred to has died
but we could also follow up with the hospital perhaps
what would also help us is if you could get lindiwe to make a
statement for us because that would give more details as well would that
this is lindiwe next to me sir
then could i ask lindiwe would you be prepared to make a
you don’t have to talk now but it would help us if you could
give us a written statement to our statement takers you don’t have to
talk now talk here i can understand you not wanting to do that but it
would help if you could answer some of the questions that ma motloung
hasn’t been able to answer could you do that 
thanks very much mr chair i have no further questions
thank you very much for coming to the commission ma motloung
and as it has been requested it would really help us if lindiwe would
also make a statement to our statement takers we will then certainly try
and follow up on whatever leads there are some of the policemen who were
involved the names that you’ve mentioned and also if lindiwe would
explain in her statement exactly what happened in the room on that day
that would also help us thanks for coming to share with us what we can
all see has been a very difficult experience and very painful for you
thank you very much could i ask people please just to sit for a few
minutes the hearing is not yet over would people please just sit down
could people please sit down before we close this hearing i think it is
necessary for us on the side of the commission to thank all of those who
have been involved it’s always very difficult when you have a hearing
spread over different places over a number of days the commission has
been hearing testimony of witnesses since wednesday in nelspruit and then
thursday in ermelo and today here in balfour there is a tremendous
amount of organization that goes into those hearings so we want to say
thank you very much to our staff for all the work that they put into
that we also want to thank the people in the different communities for
having assisted us the ministers who have been with us reverend ntembo
in particular who’s travelled from piet retief back to nelspruit and then
back to ermelo and back to balfour we really appreciate that effort and
that involvement we also want to thank they town councils for assisting
us in making venues available we want to thank the police services both
for providing protection at the hearings and also for providing
protection for the members of the commission themselves we also want to
thank the media for covering these events it’s very important that these
events that what actually happened particularly in areas like balfour
which were not always in the national newspapers that these events are
highlighted so that people can actually get to some understanding of what
was happening in these far flung parts of our country one of the things
that has actually emerged very very strongly over these there days is the
heavy heavy toll that the conflict exacted on communities that the
conflict was very often based within the community itself yesterday
when we were in ermelo we could see that in the township of wesselton
how a community divided comrades on the one side and black cats on the
ladies and gentlemen it has been a long day but i would like to
ask you all for forbearance and patience please we have one important
further witness to hear and that is bongni paris mkhize i ask him please
to come forward mr mkhize can you hear me through the headphones
thanks very much i’d like to welcome you here and to thank you
for coming to join us we missed you yesterday and we’re very pleased
that you’ve caught up with us today thank you very much for that
before you tell us your testimony i would ask doctor ally please to swear
you in so that you can take the oath
could you please stand and raise your right hand do you swear
that the testimony you are going to give will be the truth the whole
truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
thank you very much and i will ask doctor randera please to
bongani good afternoon welcome bongani we are moving away
completely from what happened in wesselton and in kwadela we’re moving
to another part of our history in a sense the history of forced removals
and you as a young man becoming caught up as a victim because of the
involvement of your father i know you’re not coming to talk about your
father but i would like to make that point your father as most people
in this community would know and many parts of our country was a fighter
for rural people and particularly for the community of driefontein i
have had the pleasure of going to your community many times myself so i
know where driefontein is it was after the death of your father that i
started becoming involved there your father in fact died two months
after what happened to you you were a young man as i said at that time
schooling in swaziland coming back to visit your family and i want you
please to now take us through what happened to you february and in a
sense what we’re going to be learning is how what appears to be just an
attack on you by police officers turns out to be much bigger than that
so i give you your time please be relaxed there’s nothing to be
frightened of tell us what happened to you
it was on the twelfth of february on a saturday i came from
swaziland and i came to visit my parents just when i got off the bus
there was an indian area as well as a boer area and i had gone to take a
bus in the indian area and i saw an e or hiace in which there was a
person who was calling me using a hand gesture when i got there i saw
eight men and showed me some identification they were policemen they
wanted to search me because i had a handbag as well as a paper bag they
searched through and they saw my written standard seven report from st
joseph’s school previously a teacher had been kidnapped from my school
and he was brought to piet retief he was kidnapped from swaziland and
brought to south africa they asked whether i knew that person and i told
them that i knew him they asked me what relationship i had with him i
told them that it was a student teacher relationship they asked me what
subject he was teaching me and they also asked me my surname i told them
that i was from the mkhize family and they asked me whether i knew soul
mkhize i said yes he’s my father and they said soul mkhize thought that
he was a clever man and at that time they were taking all the contents of
my bag as well as the paper bag and pouring it onto the floor of the car
they stated getting into the car we drove and went to supermac in piet
retief and one policeman got out of the car and went to buy some liquor
as well as meat i think they bought about forty eight cans of beer at
that time i had been made to lie flat on the back seat of the car and one
policeman went across the street and went to taxi drivers and spoke to a
certain person there was a white man as well as a black person then he
came back and we followed that e or high ace which had two occupants
it proceeded to the piet retief hospital they asked me about three
places in swaziland ngwenia park two sticks as well as fairview these
places are quite near the manzini town and i was staying at ngwenia park
they asked me about these three areas and asked whether i knew the
whereabouts of anc members who were staying around that area i told them
that i had no knowledge thereof they said i thought i was like my father
who thought that he was brilliant they proceeded to the piet retief
hospital they parked the car near a forest and started assaulting me
severely and they made me lie flat on the ground one of the boers from
the e got into the car and reversed and just when he was about to land
on me they made him stop the car and said they should give me a chance
to speak the truth and to tell them information about my father’s
involvement in politics i told them that i knew nothing they said they
didn’t believe that i was a student in swaziland there was something
else that i was doing in swaziland besides being a student they
assaulted me even further at that point they did not believe anything
that i was telling them they took me to the kombi and took me to a
certain scrap yard and said i should undress there were switches on the
wall they pressed one switch and i saw a wire protruding from the wall
they pressed another one and i saw a hole they said i must put my head
in that hole and my neck was held in that hole they started assaulting
me and electrocuting me i was naked at that time they got my head out
of that hole they took a cutting torch and said i should stand just like
jesus when he was being crucified on the cross and they switched the
cutting torch on and they burnt my chest at the time that they were
burning my chest one white man was strangling me with my own shirt and
the other one was kicking me others were hitting me and assaulting me
further whilst the other one was burning me with this cutting torch they
took me to the piet retief police station at about three o’clock on
sunday they release me and said i should go back home
bongani tell us what happened to you after that did you go
to the hospital what injuries were left with 
when i got home i got my father who was still there he took
me the following morning that is on monday to submit a statement in
piet retief i never actually went to the hospital i was actually
scorched by the burning torch but i didn’t sustain any serious injuries
i think they were just torturing me to try and get some information from
i see that you’ve lost an eye was this related to what
no i had a marble eye at that time and the marble time came
out at this stage but i had been injured in a car accident before i lost
the marble eye after the incident i lost money as well as a watch in the
forest where they were beating me up
bongani how old were you at the time you say you were a
standard seven student how old were you 
i don’t remember quite well but i was fairly young i think i
was eighteen years old i was seventeen years old but i’m not very
you said you went to the piet retief police station with your
father what was the response of the police at the time i understand
there were a few subsequent visits as well
i was with my father and we requested to see the station
commander of the piet retief police station i don’t remember his
surname we reported to him my father spoke to him at length and told
him that he should see to it that the matter proceeds further and that i
should not be tortured or asked any funny questions i submitted the
statement and my father left me with the station commander and told him
what happened to me even the police were there when i came to submit
the statement on the monday we got the police who had attacked me before
and they drove to my place and they got my mother at my place they said
they’d come to drop off my clothes because i had left them in a taxi that
was from swaziland my mother took a list of the things that they had
brought and asked them who they were but refused to identify themselves
she however took down their number plates
now the police that you identified the statement that you
made no court case was ever held am i right in believing that 
no nothing came out of the case i was never called to court
you did or your mother subsequently did take civil
proceedings against the minister of police at the time what was the
i know absolutely nothing i submitted a statement to the
station commander and i went for an identification parade they only
brought two policemen but all in all there were ten and the two that they
brought were not involved one of them was just asking me questions as to
where i lived in swaziland and whether i had a permit residence permit
in swaziland and he wanted me to tell him at length what i was doing in
swaziland but he never laid a hand on me he never assaulted me i
pointed the two out but they didn’t assault me that was the end of the
matter it never proceeded any further i even pointed out the forest
where they assaulted me and when we got there we found out that the
forest was no longer there but there were farms there or gardens that
was the end of the matter
bongani i have a document with me which shows that your
lawyers actually did sue for civil damages you may not know this the
ministry did take responsibility whereas your lawyers were asking or a
certain amount of money they didn’t fulfill although they accepted
responsibility they did not pay the sum that was being demanded they
paid a much lesser sum did you know about that 
no i have no knowledge thereof
bongani in your statement you also say that nofumela and
coetzee were part of the group that took you out of the taxi and then
subsequently were involved in your torture how did you come to find that
i discovered that when i read from the sowetan when nofumela
was testifying to the effect that they abducted me and he described the
torture in detail he even mentioned my name that’s how i came to know
that nofumela was one of them and that’s how i came to know that this
white policeman who was taking me out of the cell on sunday and told me
to pick up my clothes and he asked me whether i knew him i told him that
i did not know him he told me his name but i do not recall what he said
but i remember that his surname was coetzee he asked me when and where
were we going to meet i told him that we were going to meet in heaven
because i saw no reason for him and me to meet
did you see photographs of coetzee also at the time because
as i understand it nofumela and if i can just inform everybody you’re
referring to almond nofumela who was part of the vlakplaas unit and so
was dirk coetzee dirk coetzee did not apply for amnesty for your
torture are you sure it was dirk coetzee can i just add another point
here please and you may be completely and absolutely right as we
understand it again dirk coetzee left the vlakplaas unit in around 
that was the time that he was beginning to break from that unit as you
know he subsequently gave a lot of evidence to the harms commission i’m
just wanting to ask you whether you are sure that it was dirk coetzee who
according to what he said to me i have forgotten the first
name but i am sure about the surname he said his surname is coetzee
nofumela is the one that i’m very positive about because he described the
torture in detail that made me positive because anyone who didn’t
torture me wouldn’t have known how i was tortured
bongani my last question to you after the torture were you
able and also as i said earlier on your father died two months not much
longer two months after this horrific incident you were involved in two
months later he was shot were you ever able to finish your schooling 
tell us what has happened to you subsequently as a person
i wasn’t able to continue with my education i had to stay at
home and look after my mother i didn’t get any support or any financial
means to further my education and i do get some temporary jobs from time
to time but it’s nothing solid that i can hold on to so i just survive
on peace jobs i never went back to school thereafter
and your mother what’s happened to her 
my mother got a job at gigi and she’s working at nelspruit
bongani would you say that the police stopped harassing you
no they never harassed me thereafter
thereafter were you staying at home with the family 
yes i was i was staying at driefontein
where you part and parcel of the driefontein commission that
it’s my father who was resisting the removal and he was
actually spearheading the movement against the removal of the people
my question is not whether you were a leader but whether you
were in that community and part of the community that was resisting to be
would i say you were at the gathering where you were
confronted by the police to disperse 
no the only meeting that i went to was when my father died
that’s when a boer or a policeman came and said we should disperse
because it was an illegal gathering and my father told him that he had
convened the meeting and that he should not disperse the people that’s
when the policemen started assaulting my father he hit him with a fist
and when the people tried to intervene my father told them to stop and
the white policeman went and took out a gun he shot my father that’s
that’s the gathering i’m referring to 
thereafter the death of your father remained on most the problem first
and foremost to the family am i correct 
yes it posed a problem because we do not know why my father
was killed there was absolutely no reason we don’t know why he was
shot it’s still a mystery even today we haven’t got answers to our
where you the eldest son in the family 
which means as you put it it’s still a problem right now
at community level what became the rule of your family
after the death of your father 
my mother is the one who was attending meetings and she was
also talking on behalf of the community of driefontein i could say she
was a leader of the community of driefontein
if i heard you well paris it seems most of the people who
were torturing you even trying to overrun you by car were whites 
there was only one white policeman the rest were black
the rest were black i don’t whether at that time you had
any idea of the whole concept of removing driefotein community
tygerkrans and the lot and the lot that it reflected a grave and great
division between the blacks in the are of driefontein and the white
farming communities in the eastern transvaal am i correct to say that 
yes i could say that is true
what are the prospects now are there any prospects now
perhaps one would say how are the relations today between the white
farming community or what can we call it yes we’ll still call it the
eastern whatever you call it and the black communities that were not
removed as it was the desire of the government then 
it’s not like before i think the situation has calmed down a
bit at times we have meetings with the farmers and we do share their
views with them especially with regard to the grazing of the cattle we
are able to go to the farmer negotiate with him then they sell us some
lucerne and some feeding grass i could say the relationship is becoming
this has happened without necessarily a formal gathering
which could have been at the core a gathering for reconciliation it just
happens naturally do you understand it to be sensible 
we came together as the community because we were having a
problem with regard to the grazing fields and we didn’t have fire wood so
we decided to approach them so that we could buy firewood from them as
well as cattle feed we as the community came together and we approached
them in order to improve the relations between the two opposite groups
thank you paris no further questions
bongani mkhize i’d like to thank you very much for coming
you’ve told us of what happened to you the way in which you were
brutally inhumanely beaten and tortured i think your story gives a very
cruel twist to the old saying about the sins of the father being visited
on the children but i mean your father will always be a hero of
mpumulanga us today and to tell the story may i wish you
strength in yourself and strength in your own life that is what we can
wish you and the strong belief in yourself you come from a very proud
tradition and we’re very pleased that you could come thank you very much
	ladies and gentlemen before asking reverend kumalo to actually close our
session here in ermelo i would just like to say thank you very much to
you for having been here and i have some special words of thanks that i
would like to say on behalf of those of us here on the panel and in the
	as you can see there’s a great deal of work that has gone in to making
this session possible these hearings possible in particular it is the
people of ermelo and the local authorities through mayor madonsela who
has made this possible i’d like to thank particularly the mayor and his
staff the town clerk and the people who have helped set this up the
caterers everybody else who has made this possible it’s been a
privilege for us to be here and we’re very pleased that we have been able
	the other people who you must realize have actually made it possible
too are our contacts on the ground who over the past months not just
weeks over the past months have been working very very hard i think
particularly of reverend nkosi thank you very much sir for your help
there i think particularly of reverend kumalo as well i think of the
briefers whom we have seen today in their task and i think of the
statement takers who helped all of them please we can’t name everybody
by name but thank you very much for that assistance
	could i say a word there about statement taking this gives you some
idea of what is possible through statements what we would appeal to is
that other people come forward we have heard and we have a large number
of statements but i think that what has been shown today where we’ve
been talking quite specifically and we’ve been hearing quite specifically
about a conflict a conflict which involves if you like two sides or
possibly several protagonists antagonists we have heard statements we
have heard testimony from people if you like from only one side the
work of the commission is allencompassing what we are trying to do by
way of starting the process of reconciliation is to bring out the stories
of all people from all sides i think what we would appeal to very
strongly appeal to the community and appeal to everybody else from
within this community and in a wide area amongst all your contacts
whatever can be done to get more statements from more of the antagonists
we need the full picture we need the complete picture if it is possible
and there’s plenty of time still there’s not that much time but people
do have some time to come forward and make statements and we would appeal
to people to please come forward let us have statements from the whole
community not just the one part of the community
	i’d also in thanking people as well like to mention a special word of
thank to the saps to superintendent beukman and his men and those who
have been with us from piet retief as well and you will go on to balfour
with us thank them for keeping us safe it’s nice to be able work in
that sort of relationship now isn’t it i’d like to thank the media
particularly for their assistance i’d like to thank the commission
staff truth and reconciliation staff who also have made this possible
half of whom are now already in balfour preparing for our hearing there
tomorrow and as i said in the beginning i would like particularly to
thank those of you who have been here today who have sat so patiently
and quietly and have listened i’m sure that you feel as enriched as we
do by the experience of the hearing finally the most important people
whom we have listened to today the witnesses this has been their day
they are the people whom we must thank from the bottom of our hearts
thank you very very much for your testimony for coming forward in the
way that you have thank you very much now i’d ask reverend kumalo to
say a few words and close this hearing in ermelo
hearing closes with a hymn and a prayer
 white people as bosses referring to him as my boss
but i was not working for him in particular he was just a neighbouring
thank you for that clarification mr tshabangu in that time
were you aware of any reasons why the anc if it was the anc were you
aware of any reasons why anybody should be putting bombs on farms what
was the rational behind it what was the reasoning behind it 
i wouldn’t be able to furnish the reason because i was not
part of them and i didn’t know what their aims were
you weren’t aware of any discussions you weren’t aware that
perhaps the farms were being used by the army you weren’t aware that
some of the farmers themselves may have been members of army commando
i wouldn’t be able to comment thus far because i have no
clarity i never heard anything thereafter with regard to the bomb blast
what about yourself mr tshabangu have you ever been a member
of any political party organization or youth congress at any time 
i’m not fully conversant with politics and i’ve never been
thank you mr tshabangu i just have one last question and
then i’m finished i think somewhere in your statement you talk about a
suggestion that the commission should recommend peace parks as part of
the recommendations that we will make can you just elaborate on that
can you tell us a little more about your thinking on that
what i mean by that is that i can see that there is still
violence within our community not my community in particular but in
south africa as a whole so i think we can come together as the south
africans and talk peacefully so that we can be able to live peacefully
especially where i come from we do not have such facilities for
promoting peace we do not have any groups where we hold motivational
talks and try to reconcile with each other i would like the commission
mr tshabangu thank you very much i would like to hand over
mr tshabangu if i could just ask a few questions or two
questions really just following what doctor randera has asked could you
explain where it was that the bomb was planted was it actually planted
in the farm or was it in the road near the farm 
this bomb was planted within the farm because when you
drive from the white man’s place towards the gate and towards the main
road that’s where the bomb exploded even before i reached the road
the person planting this bomb or i presume it was a landmine
would be setting an attack for the farmers rather than for general people
travelling on the road is that right 
i think according to my own opinion it was not designated
for me but for the owner of the farm but because i was the one who drove
on that particular day and i was driving a tractor which is quite heavy
where do you think the i mean you mention the name of a
possible person who planted this landmine where do you think they came
from within the country or is volksrust sufficiently close to a border
for someone to have come across 
when i look at it now i think they were coming from
volksrust because volksrust is about ten kilometers where the bomb
exploded is about ten kilometers from where the second bomb exploded and
it was from volksrust or near volksrust location
that’s quite close to the swaziland border is it 
it’s not very near but it’s much nearer to newcastle than
my second question actually relates to what is happening now
or what happily has happened in the last weeks within our country where
south africa has been one of the people taking steps to ban the use
altogether of landmines i just wondered what your opinion of that is
what do you as a victim specifically feel about that not only for south
i support the idea because i feel that if people are happy
at times if they use fire crackers we do not know if it’s fire crackers
or it’s bombs or whatever at times when i hear fire crackers it reminds
mr tshabangu after recovery did you ever have a chance to
talk about what happened to you with your employer 
yes i did have an opportunity but when i spoke to him we
did not see eye to eye we couldn’t agree on any aspect because even
today he’s no longer staying in that area and he’s also sick when i
approached him and asked him i told him that when people have been
injured during the course of their duty they get some money to compensate
them and i asked him why i couldn’t get any compensation he didn’t want
to comment on that because i felt that had i died my mother was supposed
to get some compensation and i realized even if i had died my mother
would never have received anything from my boss and he never wanted to
take me back after i had been injured i never got any compensation
whatsoever i decided to leave his farm and i went back to the location
and i am even living there now i feel every disturbed about this
incident that’s why i left him
i don’t know whether i’m making a wrong deduction you seem
to be a very strong religious person you are a church person am i
yes that is true i do go to church and i’m quite a
religious person and whenever i go to church i feel that there’s a load
that i have lifted from my shoulders because i believe in god and
whenever i have a problem i approach him for assistance and advice
i’m trying to say having suffered this much and this man
having denied you compensation what do you think of him at this time 
are you still bitter about him let alone bitter about those who planted
well i do not necessarily hate him i have forgiven him
because i do not want take any revenge or to keep on hating him i’ve
told myself that i have to come to terms with whatever has happened to me
and i will gather my strength and collect the pieces of my shattered life
we are not certain ourselves whether the person who could
have planted that bomb has applied for amnesty but there is this general
apology that comes from one of the organizations that was involved in the
conflict of the past that is that has given a general apology about
planting all these bombs and so on what do you think about those people
who planted the bomb would you forgive them would you feel that they
i feel that i do forgive them because they have realized
their faults they have admitted that they have done wrong and they’ve
come before the community and the people of south africa at large and
they’ve asked for forgiveness i think they do deserve to be forgiven
do you have children mr tshabangu 
are they at school mr tshabangu 
yes they are at school one is in standard one and the
other one is in sub b
are you able to maintain them mr tshabangu 
well i’m not able to maintain them on my salary i’m always
assisted by my mother as i’ve already pointed out before i hold
temporary jobs and i try to make ends meet but it’s not sufficient
thank you very much mr tshabangu for your frank and honest
responses and also for your very clear statement do you get a disability
mr tshabangu by what you said in the way you responded to some
of the questions i’m sure you followed either in the newspapers or on
television the recall of the political parties by the truth commission
in particular the african national congress and you may know that during
that recall of the anc they were asked very directly about this question
of the planting of landmines in farming communities on farms on roads
adjacent to farms the then chief commander of inkontowizezwe joe modisa
acknowledged that the anc did take a decision in the ’s to intensify
the struggle and that they identified afrikaner farmers as legitimate
military targets the justification which he gave was the fact that the
then government which the nationalist party was in charge of had brought
the farming community and particularly the afrikaner farmers into the
military establishment by providing them with arms with training in
particular around border areas like in this part of the country
swaziland and because they were incorporated into the military
structures the anc therefore considered them to be legitimate targets
that’s why they decided that they would plant these landmines in these
farming areas he also made it clear that the decision which the anc took
was that they would not plant and antipersonnel mines in other words
mines which could be set off by people stepping on them but that they
would plant what was referred to as antitank landmines which required a
certain weight to detonate them we’ve seen the horrors of antipersonnel
mines in our neighbouring countries in mozabique and angola and the
damage and the harm that they’re causing mr modisa was explaining that
because of that the anc took a decision that they would not use
antipersonnel mines antipersonnel landmines he went on further to
explain that when they actually saw the consequences of this kind of
warfare that often it was not the targets that they were aiming at who
were the victims but often innocent people civilians because often it
would be the case where it would be the farm labourers who were using the
tractors as in your case in some cases farmers would be driving with
their bakkies or vans and there will be many of the farm labourers at the
back and that weight would cause these landmines to explode to detonate
and caused untold suffering and injury he then went on to say the then
president of the african national congress the late oliver tambo
actually called in the command of mk and said that they must discontinue
with this policy of landmines because of the way in which the policy was
leading to a lot of innocent people being killed or being maimed and that
this was defeating the objectives of the african national congress
following that almost order as it were from the then president oliver
tambo the anc discontinued with it’s policy of planting landmines as mr
manthata has said the anc then also made an unqualified apology to all
those who may have been victims of policies of the anc who may have lost
their lives who may have been maimed as a result of anc activities
whether as result of bombings or landmines or gorilla attacks i say that
not to provide any justification for what the anc may or may not have
done because that is not the responsibility of the commission that’s the
responsibility of the anc to justify or not it’s policies i say that
simply as providing information which came out of the recall of the
political parties and the anc in particular when this question was posed
to them you may also know that many of the members of the anc and also
of those who were in charge of umkontowezizwe including joe modisa the
now minister of defence have applied for amnesty and that i would
imagine that during these amnesty applications the amnesty hearings
many of these issued will be touched upon again and more information will
probably be furnished to the commission with those words i want to again
thank you for having come to the commission and for having been so honest
and so clear in the account of what happened to you and your experiences
just for the sake of the audience we unfortunately do not have
interpretation services from afrikaans to the other languages available
today therefore mrs joubert being afrikaans speaking will be allowed
to give her evidence in afrikaans and i will put the followup questions
in afrikaans i’m pretty sure that she will be able to follow questions
through medium english but she would be free to speak her own language
as will be the choice of all other witnesses coming to us today
	before we start i would also like to just publicly thank the foundation
for equality before the law who assisted us greatly through the last
fifteen months in accessing potential victims of gross human rights
violations especially what was perceived to be from the old south africa
and the participation of people from the old order in this process of
finding gross human rights violations getting to findings as to who were
victims or not has made a great contribution i believe to national unity
in order to allow us in a sense to frame the past as one of victims of a
conflict where there were also perpetrators who caused the violations
looking at it in a different paradigm from simply the old confrontational
dimension of the liberation versus the system i think we are learning
largely that we also now have a situation where we acknowledge that we
have victims from all sides of that conflict and we have found
perpetrators in all sides to the conflict and if we can start identifying
with each other on the basis of all of us being victims and all of us
also associated in some way or another with perpetrators not to take a
judgmental view on it not even to look at it in terms of specific moral
positions but just finding each for the sake of reconciliation and
	there will of course be a number of other issues that we will have to
discuss and decide on but the fact that the foundation for equality
before the law has assisted us greatly at their own expense in bringing
forward witnesses from the so called old order is something that we as a
commission especially in this province really appreciate
translation not acceptable transcriber’s own translation
	mrs joubert i take it is it mrs as i don’t have it on record is it
miss excuse me we don’t have on record whether you are married or not
i would also like to thank you personally for coming it gives us the
opportunity to obtain first hand information from people who were
involved therein our duties in the first place involve finding out
whether there indeed were gross human rights violations committed and
only thereafter to find out if there were any specific victims as a
result of these violations of the past i would appreciate if you could
tell us in your own word of your experience with regard to what doctor
randera said as a background to this when you are finished we probably
with have some followup questions to put to you you may remain seated
and tell you story to us by using the microphone
on the th of october i was employed by jet stores
it was about twenty past eight in the morning when i heard a loud
explosion outside suddenly the roof above us collapsed we didn’t at
first know what had happened somebody said that it was a bomb some of
the people were busy in the store upstairs one of the ladies was on the
stairs on her way to the store and a cupboard fell on top of her people
downstairs did not get hurt but lot’s of us were severely shocked this
can you tell us what your experience of this was what went
through your mind at the time
at that moment i didn’t know exactly what was happening i
just stood still and i couldn’t move when they told us that it was a
bomb i remained calm and helped some of the people who could not remain
calm by taking them through the door but after that the shock was too
when you talk about the shock what can you say about it
i would say that it did effect my life i don’t really want
to think about it but sometimes when i do i still get affected because i
do you have any information as to how this happened
no i don’t have any information i only heard that it
happened in one of the buildings somewhere people from the offices as
well as the police were also there they came to tell us about this
did you ever hear whether the matter was followed up did
anyone get arrested where there any rumours in the town or people
no there weren’t any such rumours
where to you think the bomb came from or did it just get there
what we heard was that it was planted in a car it was a
motor car bomb someone put the bomb in a motor car
i would very much like to come back to the time of the incident
because it’s important to investigate the background of the incident as
well as the time thereof one of the specific instructions of the law
which we have is to look at the motives of the responsible people of
these incidents and also at the perceptions in other words the
perceptions of people when it comes to bomb explosions therefore we want
to find out what the proper understanding of the people were when such
things happened when people were talking about it did they not say
anything as to who was responsible i’d like to find out the thoughts of
the people in general don’t be afraid to speak just relax and tell us
the time that the bomb exploded was the time that most
people were going to work early in the morning some people were already
at word i cannot say who planted the bomb
you never thought what connection there was and who possibly
could have done it or who possibly would do it or what their motives
really not this was not the first bomb explosion here was it
or was it according to your knowledge
yes this was the first one i knew of
we also have a witness i think her name is mrs harmse on our
agenda for today but i don’t know if she is here yet yes mrs beryl
harmse do you know her from anywhere she has given us a statement in
which she refers to a bomb which also exploded in the morning but on new
year’s day you have no knowledge of this
to the best of your knowledge the only bomb which exploded in
witbank is the one to which you refer
and you yourself you say that you try not to think about it
do you personally have any after effects of this incident does it still
have you made peace with the fact that this happened aren’t
no i’m not angry with anybody
thank you very much for sharing your experience with us i’ll
hand you back to our chairperson some of my other colleagues may have
further questions but you are still welcome to answer in afrikaans thank
thank you mr chair maybe i’ll ask wynand to ask on my
behalf i just wanted to check one small thing i see here that maybe
you can put your headphones on in your statement you say that you get
excuse me we can only translate from afrikaans to english
and not from english to afrikaans
my colleague commissioner miss hlengiwe mkhize has asked
whether i can question you on her behalf did you ever any clinical
treatment did you ever receive any treatment from a psychologist or a
psychiatrist to help you overcome the shock that you experience
from the scene of the incident i went to hospital but after
that i didn’t receive any psychological help
why did you go to hospital
they took all of us there to be treated for shock it was
mostly for the shock that we went
you never stayed in hospital overnight did you
if the chairperson will allow it i’d like to follow up with
one more question in your statement you say that you received
notification to attend a court case as a witness but that this was not
yes i did receive notification just after the incident
when i was still working at jet stores they said they will let us know
when and where we must go but they never contacted us again
they didn’t serve any official documentation on you such as a
they also never informed as to who was being accused of the
to the best of your knowledge was it a criminal case was
somebody implicated in connection with the bomb explosion
you never followed it up nor did you hear anything more
no they said they would contact us again and they didn’t
thank you very much what made you decide to actually come and
i already made a statement to mr killian and he suggested
that i should come to the truth commission and speak again
just for information mr killian is one of the investigators in
our office fanie killian i take it how did you get to hear about him
he contacted me how he contacted me i wouldn’t know he
so he must have got your name somewhere
ma’am can i just ask a couple of questions from the chair my
afrikaans is not so good so i apologize you when talking to mr malan
that besides the shops and offices that there were in this building
there were also the offices of some detectives is that right
was that quite a big structure for the police in the area
my second question is according to our document a young man
was killed subsequent to the bombing and the report that was released was
that he may have been responsible for the placing of the bomb in the
bank the one that you have been talking about do you remember anything
yes i only heard from one of the ladies that worked at the
nbs who was killed but i didn’t hear of the man may i read it
somewhere but not that i can remember
so as far as you are aware there was no enquiry into the
thank you are there any other questions from the panel
miss joubert thank you very very much for coming here today and sharing
your experiences with us as you heard from my opening remarks there were
a couple of people killed as well as many others who were physically
injured and we’re thankful that although you still carry the scars of
that mornings incident that you didn’t actually suffer any more harm
than what you’ve told us today already we thank you very much for
coming and sharing your experiences with us
if i could call our next witness please mr martin j coetzee
sorry it’s coetzer while mr coetzer is taking his seat i’d just like
to let you know that we do have statement takers present today there
are two rooms which are attached to the dining hall which are being used
as statement taking rooms people who have not yet made statements and
who would actually like to make statements are invited to go to either of
those rooms where we have statement takers mr coetzer it’s coetzer is
i saw that you had your wife present with you would you like
her to accompany you she is most welcome to accompany you she can come
and sit here if you want to
she would rather not do so since our small son has come with
us and he will take over everything here if we allow him on the stage
that my not be such a bad thing welcome to you mr coetzer you
are also going to speak about a landmine explosion and what happened to
you and i think it was probably around about the same time that this
happened june of mr tom manthata is going to assist you but before
we start i’d ask you if you would please take the oath do you have any
if you would raise your right hand do you swear that the
testimony which you are about to give will be the truth the whole truth
and nothing but the truth so help me god
you are welcome mr coetzer feel at home
can you please tell us what happened to you on that day when
i want to first of all use the opportunity to say to the
truth and reconciliation commission before we talk about the actual
event to thank you for the opportunity given to me to bring testimony
this morning the even also occurred on the tenth of june at about
twenty past seven in the morning in i was a matric scholar at the
volksrust high school and at that time i was eighteen years of age i
already had a driver’s licence so i used my own transport to school
	on the tuesday morning of the tenth of june i was the first person to
use the farm road this is a small entry into our house about eighty
meters away from the main road i was the first person to cross that and
the landmine was placed in a very narrow gateway only a single vehicle
would be able to pass through the gateway at the time the landmine was
planted in a hole which had previously been made by the vehicles and
because of the rain the vehicles kept on making this hole deeper and
deeper about two weeks prior to the incident i approached one of the
farm workers and asked him to level the road so that we will not always
be driving through this hole it was that particular hole which was then
	the morning of the tenth of june i was on my way i cannot recall
anything of the incident i had been in a coma for two days or i was
unconscious i woke up two days later in a johannesburg hospital i
didn’t know what had happened or why i was in hospital it was because of
the assistance of my father who came to tell me exactly what had
occurred that i later understood the event
	before i continue i want to first tell exactly what had happened the
worst of all of the entire experience was the loss of my left leg from
the knee downwards the violence of the landmine explosion blew my entire
foot away the amputation was then done about ten centimeters below my
knee as you can see i’m walking very comfortably with my artificial leg
my left leg was also broken and my right foot was also damaged and my
ankle was broken as you can read from the reports from the orthopedic
surgeon in bloemfontein which i’ve provided you with he has said in that
report that the back of my foot was entirely destroyed and it was not
possible for me to have normal use of that left other injuries was my
right arm both of the pipes of the bone was broken and also the top pipe
of the bone so there were three breakages in my arm and there are still
metal plates in my arm and in my leg there are about twenty screws and
three plates still in my arm and in my leg there is also a metal spike
in there i also had an injury to my jaw and to my skull both sides of
the jaw the jaw was broken in three different places the first evening
after the incident my leg was amputated other operations were carried
out and not all of the injuries could be treated that evening because i
had already been under anesthetic for too long and this had to then wait
for a later time for further operations 	if i recall correctly it must
have been eight days after the incident before they could begin work on
my jaw i stayed in hospital for about twenty three days
	upon my return home it was a very uncomfortable atmosphere on the farm
i returned home and did not know what to expect on my arrival at home i
did not realize how the vehicle in which i had driven had been damaged i
was under the impression that the vehicle would be able to be repaired
upon my return to the farm there was these very tense moments the
atmosphere was entirely different from before there was tension on the
farm there was tension amongst the members of my family because one did
not realize whether such an event would occur again 	apart from that i
want to continue to say what my intention is here this morning i am not
here this morning to and i must say that i have personally seen the
people who had planted the landmine i know what they look like there
were three persons involved i am not here today to blame these people
for anything or to say anything about them in a negative way my
intention here this morning is to see whether i cannot make a
contribution towards truth and reconciliation in this country
	in addition the consequences of this incident for me as a human person
was the following the first thought that one had was that of
disappointment i was disappointed that other people of this country
other south africans felt free to do something like this it is a
terrifying thought to think that we as people in south africa are not
able to live together in the love and the peace that jesus christ has
bought for us two thousand years ago on the cross the question which i
ask myself is why did this happen to me what would the purpose be of
all of this for me i quickly came to the realization that this is not
the kind of question that one should ask but rather that one should ask
how one can use that which has happened to you to serve god and how you
can use the experience to mean something to other people
	everything that happened to me i want to say today to everyone that
hears me to the whole world and it is good that everyone in south africa
wants to cooperate to bring about peace and reconciliation in our
nation however there are prerequisites to such peace and
reconciliation and the first such prerequisites which i want to share
with you is that one gets the idea that there are people who have no
feeling of remorse if everyone who is responsible for loss of life or
loss of property or whatever other loss has occurred if all of these
people want to experience true remorse that already would be a great
	a second idea which i want to emphasize is we must forgive one another
it does not matter what has happened without true forgiveness there will
never every be reconciliation in our nation i want to feel free today
to come and say here and i have already said that ten years ago in a
congregation when i was asked by a local minister to bring testimony that
i have forgiven and forgotten end of tape we will walk
around with feelings of revenge in our hearts after all god tells us in
the bible that we must not seek revenge we must not answer evil with
evil in god’s word he said to us that we must obey him
	i want to quote from philippines three verse fourteen which reads i am
able to do everything because of jesus christ who gives me strength if
in the process of reconciliation we want to recognize jesus christ as
our saviour then the process of reconciliation will be far easier to
	i also want to refer to philippines four verses six to seven which
reads do not be concerned for anything but rather in every case bring
your needs and desires to god through prayer and with pleading and with
	in verse seven then the peace of god which exceeds all reason will be
in your thoughts and hearts and will guard you in christ jesus should we
therefore not hold onto and obey god’s command in scripture then all
efforts towards true reconciliation will not succeed true reconciliation
will only be possible if we forgive one another as i’ve already
mentioned if there is true forgiveness for one another as christ has
forgiven our sins through his blood on the cross in conclusion in south
africa we must take great care with regard to the problem of peace and
reconciliation not to try and achieve this through human means as human
beings we have theories we have notions we have techniques for
approaching problems this is simply normal and there’s nothing wrong
with this but however if we want to do this entirely out of our own
strength we will fail we must prayerfully approach this process we
must recognize our dependence on jesus christ who achieved salvation for
us two thousand years ago on the cross reconciliation in this nation in
our nation will only be possible if this reconciliation gives jesus
christ his proper place the bible also tells us that we must know him in
all of our ways and he will smooth our way
	i therefore conclude despite everything that has happened i am not at
all sad about what has happened anymore i am grateful to god for both
the suffering which i experienced and the strength which god has given me
and will give me in the past eleven years god has given me strength i
want to thank god for the strength which he had given me to accept that
which has happened to me and that he has helped to forgive those who
perpetrated this act it is my prayer and the prayer of my heart this
morning that the holy spirit will work in every south african so that we
will be bound together in true peace and true reconciliation and i want
to emphasize this true reconciliation must be through jesus christ who
made this possible on the cross i thank you very much
mr coetzer can i ask you whether the sentiments you have
expressed here are shared by you your family that is the wife and
children and your family father mother and brothers 
my response to this would be the following it is a very
clear yes i cannot involve my parents in this since both of my parents
have since died my mother in and my father in my wife is
present here today and she will be able to testify that what i say is
true that they agree with me that no reconciliation is possible except
at that time you were still a student do you recall the
impact that the explosion could have made to your fellow students at the
time that is your school mates 
i will have to give hearsay evidence now if mean what the
immediate incident of that morning was it was an incident which brought
about panic and uncertainty as i understand it the school children did
not know how to respond they were frightened that something like this
might even happen in their school that there might be hidden bombs or
even landmines on the school property as i’ve said to you as you know i
was not personally conscious i was not able to know how people responded
immediately but from what i’ve also been told by the principal of the
school this created chaos that morning
and thereafter you have never had the opportunity to meet
some of your fellow exstudents i understand the immediate chaos but in
the process of your healing and in the process of what was attained in
the country you have never got to know what impact the whole incident
this is a very difficult question the actual impact on my
friends i would not be able to gauge what the true feeling in their
hearts would have been i don’t know we never actually discussed that
aspect of the event to really ask people who they felt about the events
i would imagine that they would have felt disappointed and shocked since
this had been the first time in the history in the volksrust environment
that that happened how they upon reflection felt about it i do not
know i must be entirely honest with you i simply do not know what their
feelings and the feelings of other persons had been
with apology i’m asking the question because i feel this is
how you have correctly described the incident this has national
implications and we would want to see reconciliation taking place almost
at national level and it’s at this stage that we are trying to say what’s
going to guide us and to guide the nation and everybody is to find out
how many share this kind of view you have put it very clearly that
forgiveness reconciliation this should only be perfect if it is done
through god but at the same time we maintain that god works through his
people are there practical things that you can suggest that the people
of god can do to actualize forgiveness and reconciliation besides that
the two communities or whatever communities that were previously were in
conflict can do together don’t worry i think that you may not have had
a change to reflect upon this but i thought you could just throw one two
or three ideas which can guide the truth and reconciliation commission
as you have truly said this is a very difficult question i
want to link to my previous comment namely that there has to be remorse
and also an honest telling to the truth there must be a testimony of
what had occurred alongside the idea of forgiveness these things must
come together if we can share our ideas with one another if we can tell
one another that we must forgive one another then forgiveness can
happen as to the process of how we should forgive one another if we do
not want to forgive one another then there will not be forgiveness for
all of us who continue to hold in our hearts the idea that the events of
the past has hardened us entirely so that we are not able to forgive for
those who do not want to show remorse these persons will not be able to
join in the process of reconciliation because they will not want to bring
their share to the process of reconciliation i don’t know if i’m making
thank you mr coetzer i hand you back to the chairperson
mnr coetzer baie dankie could i just ask one brief question
which i also asked the previous witness and probably unnecessary could
you just tell us what is your reaction to the action by the south african
government to ban altogether the use of landmines 
i will wholeheartedly support this suggestion or
recommendation my personal feeling is that this is a cowardly act a
most extreme cowardly act which any person can perpetrate against
another to entirely ban this in our country would be one of the most
valuable contributions towards peace and reconciliation thank you
mr coetzer in your statement you’ve very clearly told us
what to your parents and you said already that they passed away i think
you mother in and your father in do you feel that this was
related to what happened to you 
i would not want to see this as directly the cause thereof
in the case of my father i can say that he was a person who suffered from
heart trouble and the incident of that day effected him to such an extent
that the staff of the general hospital that evening of the tenth of june
wanted to take him up in the hospital for shock i would assume that
might well have had a negative effect on his health in general whether
it in fact reduced the length of his life there’s a possibility but i do
not think that one can make a direct cause or a link
mr coetzer again earlier on you so eloquently talked about
reconciliation and forgiveness i think you’re looking back with
hindsight at what happened to you but can you tell us what your thinking
was at the time as a young white person of eighteen about to start
university i would have thought and the generation that grew up with you
on the farms in the schools we’ve heard already earlier on mr
tshabangu referred to you people as the boss what was the thinking about
of yourself and others in terms of the conflicts that were taking place
in our country i’m not asking for a general statement because you were
part of a group of young people you grew up in a community and you went
to a school which was altogether white what was the thinking about at
that time that prevailed in yourself and your friends 
at that time as you have said the circumstances in our
country the circumstances of our lives were entirely different from
those of today this is a difficult question a very difficult question
from the very beginning i grew up in a home where conflict and things
like conflict was not allowed i grew up in a christian home with
christian values to speak very specifically about our family if you saw
the video material of the sabc if you could see the words of my father
his very clear words at that time was that we bear no hatred against
those who committed this act we do however feel hatred against the act
itself that is what my parents themselves said the attitude of the
community however that would be difficult i have some difficulty i was
a very young person at that time i could not think about these events in
the same way as i do today so you are asking me a very difficult
reading through your statement again what comes across so
clearly is the difficulty that your family went through initially i
understand your parents had a medical aid and that covered some of the
expenses but later on that medical aid ran out and your father lost his
farm you went insolvent what surprises me is how little support the
then government gave to you and your family would you like to comment on
i no longer have the exact amounts of the medical costs i
can give you some indication that the medical costs must have been around
fifty to sixty thousand rand at that time we received an amount from the
socalled state president’s fund an amount of forty thousand rand which
was paid out to us the medical fund was then exhausted this fund was
not sufficient for the medical costs related to the incident and i want
to make it clear that i do not want to say by this that money would
return me my health or my leg but the mere idea that what one has
experienced the difficulties which i had to experience as a young
person i’ve mentioned that i was in a flourishing period of my life i
was a very fit young person i was a very active sports person i never
sat around for a single moment i ran around all the time and this was
cut as if with a knife money itself cannot return one’s leg but we were
disappointed in some of the letters which had been written to us in which
it had been said that no further additional funds would ever be
considered at a later stage i managed to address an additional request
to the state president’s fund with regard to the replacement of my
artificial limb for which i did not have funds i made an application i
asked for assistance which they did provide and that was the only
additional assistance from their side which i received beyond that we
have never heard anything or received any support from such institution
despite what happened to you and having been left with the
disabilities that you have today you appear to overcome many of those
problems i understand that you’re a student at free state university in
my opinion there are thousands of people like yourself in our country who
haven’t actually had the opportunities of the best medical treatment
available in our country that you have had as you know we have to make
recommendations to our government would you like to make from your own
experiences for the treatment that you’ve had thinking that’s gone on
would you like to put your thoughts as to what recommendations we should
be making towards assisting people who have been disabled through the
conflicts of the last thirty four years 
i do not know what the exact position would be financially
speaking to assist such persons i do feel that should the present
government be able to do anything like this then they should particularly
where persons have physical difficulties because of that which they have
experienced i would like to recommend that be assisted as far as it is
possible these victims should be assisted insofar as it is possible
regardless of what had happened to them i don’t say that the government
should go beyond it’s abilities and that there should be damage done
because of these efforts but as far as possible most or if possible all
of the victims should be assisted with regard to medical expenses
mr coetzer you say that you actually had the opportunity to
meet those who planted this landmine can you tell us a little about
that how did that happen what was the circumstances of you meeting
it must of been around may of the security police made
contact with me and asked me to indicate the place where the landmine had
been planted the government of that day provided me with a air travel
fare to johannesburg from bloemfontein they then collected me at the
them jan smuts airport took me through to the farm where the security
police had the three persons whom they had taken into custody these
persons were present i stood next to them they were under very great
police security so i couldn’t have any personal contact with them i
could only see them i was close enough to touch them but i could only
point out the place it was at our farm gate at that time and that is
where i saw them and those were the circumstances under which i met them
you also in your statement seem to suggest something happened to
them subsequently do you want to comment on that make some comments
about what happened to them after this incident 
these are only rumours which i have heard i don’t know what
truth there would be in these rumours i wrote a letter i’m sure exactly
who this was but if i recall correctly it was towards the persons in
charge of the state president’s fund at that time and i’ve said to them
that i’ve heard rumours that the persons who had planted the landmine
were political prisoners and that they had been released what was
reported back to me was that this information could not be made known to
me that it was not appropriate had occurred where this is true or not i
would not know i would assume that in the process of reconciliation when
the political prisoners were released that they would have been part of
those who were released that’s what i assume
is this something that you would like to know 
for interests sake i would i assume be interested but this
not the alpha and the omega to know this in my heart i believe that if
this is part of the reconciliation process for them to be released i
would have no difficulty with this if all of us wants to achieve
reconciliation in our nation and if they are willing to turn themselves
towards reconciliation i would have no difficulty with them being out
mr coetzer did you follow or read about the recall of the
political parties that took place last week did you follow any of that 
no i did not follow the media in any way last week
just more generally then you made the point that an important
condition maybe the most important condition for reconciliation is
genuine remorse just generally do you think that the political parties
organizations or any other actors party to this conflict of the past do
you feel that there has been genuine remorse with regard to those who
this is once again a difficult question i do not think that
every single person actually has shown true remorse and i want to repeat
if you only go as far if people can only bring themselves so far as to
show remorse and if people want to also continue to forgive because
remorse and forgiveness must go hand in hand if you show remorse then
this automatically almost brings about forgiveness it is my prayer that
those people who were victims and those people who were perpetrators
that there will be true remorse to take a part in the process of
mr coetzer again thank you very much for coming to the
commission and thank you for being so forthright in your opinions it’s
clear that you did suffer a very horrific physical injury and as a young
person in the prime of your life it must be very hard i think that for
all of us here on the panel it is quite inspirational in many ways to
hear how you have actually coped the fact that you display almost no
bitterness that your plea is for genuine remorse for forgiveness for
reconciliation to move away from the bitterness of the past from the
divisions of the past i think that for us in the commission it’s always
very reassuring when victims can display that kind of attitude and that
willingness to want to contribute towards reconciliation because i’m sure
you must know that the truth commission often gets quite a rough ride in
that we’re accused of divisions of being biased so it’s very
heartening for us when victims come forward and speak in this way and
actually also applaud the process which the truth and reconciliation
commission is engaged in from all of us in the panel thank you very
much for coming and for sharing your experience with us
seeing that it’s already half past eleven i think we will bread
for tea and we will recommence at five to twelve thank you
can i just ask is beryl harmse here no or christinah
mkhatshwa she is here perhaps i could ask christinah to come forward
because it’s an incident related to the bombing can i just explain these
boxes to people i know a lot of people actually have them already so i
won’t actually go into too much details it’s for the interpretation
services that we provide here english is on two and zulu is on three
thank you these boxes please are very fragile if you can handle them
with care and leave them when you go out for tea or lunch and most
certainly at the end of the day for those of us who have cell phones
can you please switch off your cell phones christinah good morning
welcome christinah you have come to talk about your father jacob
masuku your father in fact was killed in the bomb blast that we’ve
heard already miss mkhize is going to be helping you as you tell your
story but before i hand over to her will you please stand to take the
mrs mkhatshwa if you could please raise your right hand and
swear that the evidence you give today will be the truth the whole
truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
christinah we welcome you here i would like you to be
comfortable and explain your story to this commission before we get
started won’t you please tell us the story of your late father and
my father was not a political person he used to fix
i would like you to explain to this commission how he met
my father left for work in the morning and we told him
that we wanted money so we could buy food my two kids accompanied him
and asked to him to come home early not late that day i was at home
drinking my tea which was on the table suddenly to my surprise the cup
cracked and i thought to myself this must mean something i went outside
and stood there for quite some time my mom said i should go to the
indian store and buy meat and vegetables i didn’t feel that i could do
that because i’d just heard that there was a bomb explosion in town
however i did go to the indian store and when i got there i heard that
there really was a bomb explosion i suddenly felt terrible when i was
walking back home i met a couple of ladies and they told me that there
were people who died in the bomb explosion one other lady said some were
black people and i wondered who they were we saw a kombi with policemen
in it they parked right at my house and i wondered who they were looking
for because i’m the only one at home and my mom wasn’t well and we also
don’t have boys who could have been naughty when i approached the
police i asked them who they were looking for and they said they wanted
my dad’s id i asked why they wanted my father’s id it was myself and
my mom and i was adamant and asked them why they wanted the id they
just insisted that we should give them the id i asked my mom for it and
she gave it to me i in turn gave the id to the police suddenly they
said yes this is the one i asked why are you saying this is the one i
suddenly cried and asked is there anything wrong is he hurt because we
already heard that there was a bomb explosion in town i offered to go
with them to the scene of the crime we first went to masina’s house the
one who died with my father in that same bomb explosion when we got
there we found that the wife mrs masina was waiting for her husband
because her husband had left in the morning saying he was going to the
bank i was in the vehicle crying continuously they did not confirm that
my father was dead but i could sense it in one way or the other i kept
asking them to come out to the surface with the truth but they did not
want to do that i asked mrs masina whether she had information about
this she also did not have any information
	we went to the police station instead and i asked why and where are we
going they said we should relax we went inside the police station
building when i passed in the hallway i saw two bodies that were
covered and i wondered who those people were they took me to this
particular white man and he asked me my name and i told him that i am
christinah he asked me whether this was my father and i said yes this
is my father he then asked for my mother and i told him the state in
which my mom was they held me on both sides and one gentleman
approached wearing gloves and opened one of the bodies and i realized
straight away that it was my father i could tell that my father had
died i submitted a statement and i could hear mrs masina crying as well
they asked me many questions i answered what i knew and what i could
some questions were repeatedly asked and i answered as best i could i
just wanted to go back home and i asked how i would get home because i
had no transport mrs masina had relatives with her and they gave me a
lift back home they neighbours were also surprised at what had happened
when i got home i could not speak properly and my mother was lying down
i told her that my father was caught in that incident as well as mr
masina and that they both had died we started making funeral
thank you mrs mkhatshwa i would like to ask you a few
questions so that you can explain and clarify some aspects on which we
are not clear after this incident which you’ve related maybe one of the
neighbours or people of the community had the inside of the story do you
what we heard as a family was that the bomb was planted
at the bank or at the clerk i’m not too sure exactly where the bomb was
planted because those buildings were destroyed we just heard that the
teachers were responsible for that we were called by those teachers in
middleburg they wrote a letter to me informing me that i should appear
in front of them one of the policemen came to tell me that and gave me
the letter saying that on a certain date i should go to middleburg we
met those two gentlemen we attended and the case went on the first time
i went they showed us a film and we saw exactly what happened as well as
the damage that was caused we couldn’t view the whole thing so we left
because we felt that the scars and the wounds were being reopened we
were never called after that we just heard that the case was over how
and what happened we don’t know
what about the bomb was it planted by the teachers or what
no i don’t know their names but we heard that it was
when you say you were called and you met them did you get
any explanation from the teachers that would help so that the family can
know exactly what happened who planted the bomb and what was their
objective did you gather any information in this regard
i wouldn’t know because we just heard that they planted
the bomb and the bomb was designated for certain people not for the bank
now that we talk about the past and we’re trying to tie the
past with the future how much knowledge do you have about the past and
i don’t have any knowledge as far as that is concerned i
think the bomb was planted and designated for the cid apartment flats
the rumour i heard was that the bomb was not designated for the bank but
for the flats the apartment flats again i don’t have details regarding
what about the cid apartment flats that you are talking
no those were offices of doctor clarke who was the
neighbour a furniture shop as well as the cid’s offices in that building
thank you i will hand you back to the chairperson who may
mrs mkhatshwa can i just ask a few questions you have
mentioned the two teachers in the documentation which we have there’s
also a report that came later in the year in november saying that
i’m quoting that an anc activist had been apprehended this was in a
statement from the then minister adriaan vlok do you know anything
i don’t know the name of those people who were arrested i
you don’t know whether they were charged
as far as i know they were sentenced but i don’t know what
happened after that the last thing we heard that they were somewhere in
middleburg we don’t know anything regarding the verdict we just heard
that the case was over and the people were sentenced
you didn’t hear of another case in november where someone who
was said to be involved was actually chased and shot in vosloorus you
didn’t hear of that at all did you
no i didn’t hear anything like that i have not knowledge
could i ask a general question about how you in the community
you in particular were affected because of what happened to your family
you were involved very personally how did you feel at the time
things changed after that my health deteriorated and even
today i still can’t forget my father each time i come across
difficulties i remember him and think if only he was around i could
call on him and he would respond he would be there for us the whole
family miss him a great deal
yes i’m sure outside of that personal grief have you come to
terms with the i suppose what we could call the political reality of
what happened that this was obviously a planned attack to try and bring
change how did you react then and how do you feel now
i don’t accept anything that happened then and even now
today we don’t have a father and other people have fathers other
children have fathers we miss our father that’s all i can say
christinah can i just ask one other questions you spoke
earlier on about your perceptions as to why the bomb was placed outside
that building can you tell us what else was happening in witbank at that
time i said there was some elections to take place local council
elections to take place the next day but in the township or in the town
was there a lot of political activity taking place in 
i don’t remember i don’t have any recollection of that
if my memory serves me right i would say that the situation that
prevailed at the time was stable i was a person who was not involved
with political things and unrest i don’t have any recollection of the
situation that prevailed at the time i might have forgotten many other
things especially when i was younger
my other question is to do with these teachers you mentioned
or these two people who were arrested as far as you know were they from
no they didn’t come from witbank i’ve forgotten where
they came from but they weren’t from witbank
thank you christinah i have no further questions is there
have you tried to get in touch with a psychologist because
what we’ve found out is that people suffer these atrocities and after
i don’t understand what you are talking about
i’m talking about councelling of some kind maybe
psychological councelling or pastoral councelling have you tried to do
something of this sort so that you may start your life afresh
i used to attend roman catholic women’s gatherings and i
am the type of person who prays a lot i pray because i do believe that
god will enlighten our future and our way
what i’m thinking here is that we as the truth commission
do provide services to enlist help to people like yourself who have
undergone atrocities besides prayer we do have other help such as
psychological councelling i’m asking about that in particular have you
tried that have you tried to get in touch with the social workers for
christinah thank you very much for coming i don’t think
anybody in this hall or anybody else listening to what you said cannot
but be touched by what you said about how the loss of your father has
affected you regardless of what the political conflict was at the time
you and your family suffered an enormous loss and you continue to show
the scars of that even today we empathize with you on that we have
some information already but we need to go back and look at what happened
in this area because clearly you would also like to know although you
have some impression that some people were arrested and charged and
sentenced from what you’ve said you would like to know who these people
were and why the bomb was planted in that particular area we hope that
we will be able to come back to you with some of that information in due
course thank you very much for coming today before i call the next
witness i just want to clarify something i said earlier on i said today
was the last day of hearings in this area but that does not mean that
we’ve stopped taking statements people who are working with the truth
commission will continue taking statements in this area and already
christinah for example mentioned the name masina elias masina who was
the other person who was killed in that bomb blast but we don’t have a
statement from him and so if people in the audience here know of other
individuals who were victims of gross human rights violations please
encourage them to continue making statements the life of the commission
goes on until december of this year so we will continue taking
statements in the office but people in the area will be taking statements
over the next month or two and today sorry there are people if there
are people who want to make statements today we have statement takers
in the foyer so if you want to go out quietly and give your statement
that will be most welcome thank you very much
before i begin are you accompanied by somebody would you
introduce the person who’s come with you
welcome to your mother before i ask doctor randera to assist
you with your statement will you please stand and raise your right hand
to take the oath thank you
mr mnisi good morning to you and to your mother welcome to
mr mnisi you are living in siyathemba we were told this
morning that this is the town of hope you’re taking us to two periods
one in and the other one in the first one related to something
where thousands of our people struggled against it when many of our
political organizations were banned in sharpville and the killings
that took place in sharpville resulted because of a protest against the
dom pass or the pass law you are going to take us to what happened
to you first there and the experiences you had and then the second one is
related to a much more difficult time in your community but what we saw
throughout south africa a struggle against local councils rent boycotts
and the results that came out of that so take your time tell us about
what happened in both situations please
i would like to take this opportunity to thank the chairperson
and the entire committee it was in the morning at about nine o’clock on
the eleventh of october i went to the shop to buy a cooldrink and i
met a boer by the name of fanie de beer who was working at the local
police station this policeman tried to stop me along the road and asked
for my passbook and the lodger’s permit i told him that left those
documents at home he told me to get inside the police van i refused and
told him that the only people will get into the police van are the ones
who are arrested he locked the car and we walked back to my house i
opened the door and went inside i tried to look for the documents he
wanted they were in my mom’s bedroom and they were at work during the
day i told him the documents you want from me are in this bedroom but
i’m unable to get in because it’s locked he told me i should kick the
door open so i can gain entry and get the documents i told him he better
do that so my mom and dad will hold you responsible for that he was
adamant that i should kick the door open and i refused i told him that
the owners of the bedroom are at work and i can’t do that he started
assaulting me at that time he hit me with a fist and i asked him are
you fighting now or do you want a lodger’s permit he said to me kick
this door open i told him that i won’t do that after that i hit him
back because i realized that he was fighting when i hit him back he
fell on the sofas when he fell on the sofas he drew his gun and shot me
on my right thigh on my right foot when i tried to step down i realized
foot was broken he left i fell into the kitchen from the dining room
and he went back to the dining room he closed the curtains i just heard
the sound that he was closing the curtains he went past me in the
kitchen went outside and brought more police into the house one of them
was a sergeant station commander i have forgotten his name i think he
is maboya he is joubert something like that the station commander he
brought with him asked what happened to this gentleman and he told him
that he’s already shot me because i didn’t have a pass book and a
lodger’s permit in my possession he wanted to find out why he didn’t
arrest me instead of shooting me the station commander said to the other
policemen they should take me to the van and we drove to town to doctor
lindeque and he put me under the xray and it was discovered that i had a
fracture and i was transferred to heidelberg hospital i was admitted
there for a day the following day the doctors came to attend to me and
the same results were obtained i was transferred from there to
natalspruit hospital it was there that i was operated on they inserted
screws into my foot i was shot for the lodger’s permit and pass book and
i had those things it’s just that i could not get them because they were
in the bedroom and the bedroom was locked that’s what happened
mr mnisi can i ask for the indulgence of a chairperson
perhaps we should just talk about this one incident because the second
one is related to something completely different and there are many other
stories that will follow that will talk about what happened in so
if i can just ask you a few questions on what happened in you must
have spent a long time in hospital how long were you in hospital for 
in natalspruit hospital i spent three months if i’m not
when you came back to interrupted
when i was discharged i went back home the first day the
second day the police came and took me to the charge office locally and i
was told that the person who shot me opened a docket for me and there’s a
case ready that i should attend at the court of law
had you laid any charges either whilst you were in hospital
i was kept at the hospital for three months and i couldn’t lay
so you hadn’t laid any charges yourself against the policeman
the police first laid charges against me
the charge against you was that you actually tried to attack
the policeman with an axe what’s your comment about that 
he alleged that i wanted to stab him and chop him with an axe
that is not true he is the one who shot me to my surprise that was the
tell us what happened did you actually end up in prison or
was the case dropped against you did you get a sentence that was
i wasn’t sent to prison but i got free bail at the end of the
case i was sentenced to three years suspended sentence
were you working at the time 
i wasn’t working at the time i was a vendor
what about your present status are you working now 
i’m not working now i have since not been employed
mr mnisi going back to your statement you say in the
police were in full force trying to stop the influx of people into urban
areas by arresting those who do not have pass books this is quite a
small community i would imagine in it was even smaller just take
us back to that time and describe how these things were being done and
your own experiences as well interrupted
the police were arresting people who were not employed if you
had a special you were not arrested but if you didn’t have one you would
be arrested even if you didn’t pay the rent you would be arrested for
would the police come in to siyathemba and arrest people and
carry out raids at night or during the daytime 
people used to come day and night raiding the house siyathemba
and arresting people they were not joking
chairperson if i may i’d would like to move on to mr
mnisi would you like to say anything else about that period before
you come to tell us what happened in 
i would like to know about fanie de beer i would like to know
his whereabouts because he is the one who injured me
we’ll take note of that thank you would you like to go on
and tell us what happened to you in 
if i’m not mistaken it was the seventh of july it was on
a saturday i was at home at tshabala’s place and we were there chilling
and relaxed and we saw a group of people approaching they came inside
and asked the owner samuel tshabala to switch off the radio and after
that we should leave the house and go and attend a meeting at the
stadium they also said further anyone who’s stubborn and not attend the
meeting will receive what he deserves truly we went to the stadium
when we got there we found out that the people who were at the stadium
were leaving the stadium marching because there was a march that day
and headed towards the office we had buckets with us they told me to
take a bucket and i refused i said i will never take this bucket i
won’t even touch it and they said but you will join the march i did
obey them i joined the march there were so many people numerous the
one’s were controlling the march that day divided us some were already
in front and reached the office unloading the buckets and they got back
to us and suggested we go to ngakane who was a councillor ngakane
ngakane’s house we found ngakane ngakane standing outside his house we
put our buckets down i knew ngakane ngakane very well because we grew up
together and we used to play soccer together and we used to be vendors i
said to the people who were with me that i would like to have a word with
mr ngakane they intended to kill him and i went to ngakane and i had a
word with him i told him to just leave the weapon alone take your
weapon and put it in your pocket and leave these people to offload their
buckets and leave them there and we will clean up afterwards we will
clean your house thereafter he was stubborn and said he won’t do what i
was asking him to do as i was still trying to negotiate with him there
was one who approached behind me i don’t know whether he threw sand on
his eyes because i saw him reaching for his eyes and suddenly boetie
nkala i would like to apologize because his family is here shot him i
told him you shouldn’t have done that because look at the damage you
have made now suddenly i found myself on the ground and i don’t know how
i was beaten after that i found myself at the heidelberg hospital and i
had lost consciousness but i regained it again magdeleni nklapo was also
injured that day on his foot and came to my hospital bed with the late mr
skothana and said to us the reason we are here in this hospital is
because we’ve been shot by speed the late ngakane i said did he shoot
us what did we do i asked nklapo that and he said the whole thing
transpired as we were offloading the buckets at his house i asked where
he was and he said he was also killed on that very day i said to
magdeleni nklapo look at this now he created all this damage but if
only he had listened to me this wouldn’t have emanated at all because i
suggested to him that he should leave the whole thing alone and let the
people do whatever they wanted to do and we will clean up the mess
thereafter that’s what happened i felt really bad when i realized that
he was killed if only he had listened to me this wouldn’t have happened
and we wouldn’t have been hurt either
how many people actually died on that day mr mnisi 
there was one who died on the way to hospital by the name of
boetie nkala the other one sugar died after him the two of us myself
and magdaleni are the ones who survived this ordeal
and your friend the councillor also died on that same day 
that’s what i heard because we were already at the hospital we
heard that he died that day or the following day i’m not too sure about
can i just take you back a little i know it’s a long time
ago what was this struggle against councillors in siyathemba had that
been taking place for a period of time or did that only start in 
the councillors were working for the government of the day and
also working for the community and had made promises to the community
time and time again the community would have meetings about this until
they reached a decision that they would destroy and use buckets to show
the councillors what they were up to that they were not keeping their
promises that’s how they wanted to penetrate through
were there other protests against the town’s councillors
before this incident in was this one of many protests that took
place sorry can i just stop you my understanding of the protests
against councillors started long before in the vaal we go back to the
early ‘’s already was there a similar situation pertaining in
siyathemba at the time or had people just started being against
an incident like this had occurred before but not as bad as
this time in there were conflicts and debates and things but not to
the protest with the buckets was that a protest against the
bucket system in itself or was it just a way to show the councillors that
the community was trying to show the councillors that they
should not make promises that they know very well they won’t fulfill
they promised a sewerage system and they were not installing that so the
community decided that they will use the buckets to effect service and
show the councillors that they were tired of promises that were not
earlier on you said that people were so angry they wanted to
kill councillor ngakane even before your intervention was that the plan
 was that the thinking as people marched to councillor ngakane’s house
that they were going to actually kill him or were they going to drop all
the feces there in his yard and walk away 
i would like to explain this point there was no conflict even
the people who were there in that march were not up to a conflict people
were just going to offload the buckets as i tried to negotiate with him
that he should take his gun back into his pocket and leave the people to
do what they wanted to do and we will clean up afterwards but he didn’t
see any sense in what i was saying to him everyone that was there was
not up to any mischief except that they wanted to offload the buckets and
now i understand the councillors lived in the community and
people were against the councillors and they were the direct point of
entry in terms of anger that people were showing but you said earlier on
that the councillors were just working for the government why did people
not go and drop all the shit out in balfour itself why were the
councillors chosen as the ones they should be attacking 
the offices of the councillors were in the black township not
in town they went to the offices first and after that they went to their
respective houses they wouldn’t have gone to town because the
councillors were working right in the township
so people had been protesting for some time against the
bucket system councillors had been forewarned about this is other words
yes the councillors were aware of that they committed
themselves to changing the entire system and install a sewerage system
but they never fulfilled their promise
mr mnisi my last question i understand that after you came
out of hospital you were charged for the killing of the councillor can
you just tell us what the outcome of that was
we were discharged at the court of law we won the case all of
how many of you were charged 
i think we were about thirty or fifty something around that
neighbourhood this has happened a long time ago so i can’t remember
mr mnisi could i just ask this was one of many protests was
it the last protest about the bucket system 
this was not the last bucket protest because the people in the
specifically about the bucket system does it still exist 
so there’s never been any success for this particular protest 
no there wasn’t we only experienced a change now under the new
government because they have started installing the sewerage system
that’s what i wanted to ask thank you
mr mnisi can you remember how the councillor was killed 
when he was killed i was not in the neighbourhood i was
were you at any stage in the leadership of the community
i was not at the meeting i was one of the community one of
the civilians and i grew up in this township
you were able to speak to the councillor i guess you were
speaking to the councillor on behalf of the people when you said he
should let everything happen it shall be cleaned later
no i was not representing the community i was talking to him
simply because he was a friend a personal friend of mine and i realized
the danger he was getting himself into by holding his firearm
as you were speaking to him where were the marchers were
they standing looking at you negotiating with him 
they were there watching and they knew very well that he was my
friend we grew up together we were playing in one soccer team and we
you said you are not working now mr mnisi is your wife
so you are just staying with mama and you are supporting
mr mnisi thank you very much for sharing with us 
i will request the commission to understand one thing i am now
no longer as fit and as healthy as i used to be before and i won’t be
able to work anymore as result of that incident

you’re not how many children are there in the family mrs
there are nine are they all at school mrs nkosi 
the others have completed their studies some are working
oh so they are working i guess the memory of lucky much
as you are a very lucky family in the sense of numbers that you should
be a happy family but the memory of lucky makes the whole family
can you please tell us this sad story of the abduction and
it was on monday we heard that people were assaulted by the
black cats those people who were representing the community about the
rent boycott so there were some riots because there was this group
called the black cats people were complaining about rent during that
time and people were saying that rent should be brought down
	on that monday we heard that they were assaulted by the black cat some
of them were hospitalised there were so many these people were taking
boys from the houses who were in pumla who were staying in pumla they
went to the extension they went to the house of the leader of the black
cats we heard that there were people comrades from bethal davel and
ermelo when they arrived there lucky and sepo my sons they trying to
retrieve they were taken they started assaulting them they entered a
place where he was hiding himself they attacked that place they burnt
it down and managed to escape lucky when he was standing on the lawn
outside the yard they fired a shot at him there was one guy who was
coming from doge and when he went there to go and look what happened he
found that lucky was shot they put him in a kombi they came across his
father who was coming from work they came back home we found that the
bullet entered his palm we thought of taking him to hospital we heard
that the police were there and soldiers and if they find that these
people got injured they would take them and go and detain them when we
looked at his hand we found that he put his hands in the police were
standing outside so we were afraid to take him to ermelo’s hospital
because they will take them to jail and then we decided to go to bethal
and he died on the way to bethal then we came back his father went to
the police station to report the matter and safas came to take him after
we have buried him after some few days i think after a month and some
two weeks another guy called bini said lucky was shot by nkosi who was
working and ran away he was hiding there was a railway policeman and he
was hiding himself in a car he said they were standing outside and then
he ran away and i was shot on my back by these policemen we didn’t have
any idea how lucky got injured we heard by rumours that nkosi killed him
and we heard that the comrades assaulted nkosi he was hospitalised but
we never had any information as to how lucky was killed until this guy
told us this guy said when he saw lucky falling down and then he looked
onto the guy he saw that nkosi was inside a car he was the one who shot
at lucky and shot at me again
we have just began to hear or to learn about the black cats
mrs nkosi you are talking about the rent boycott who was behind the rent
boycott was it the community was it the students or the youth who
actually was behind the rent boycott 
it was the community at large and what i knew at that stage
was that the people were very dissatisfied with their rent hikes and we
had a representative whom we sent forward to air our grievances with
regard to the rent hikes his name was jonah ndevele as well as other
members who were representing the community so that we should bring the
did the councillors ever explain to the people why the rent
no we never had any explanation from the councillors
was there never anything new that was done by the
councillors that showed where the rent increases were being spent on 
there were toilets new toilets that were installed because we
were using the bucket system and they also installed electricity and they
wouldn’t you say therefore mrs nkosi that you know on the
basis of those toilets houses sorry streets that there was a reason
for the people and the community councillors at that time to sit together
and talk about the use of the increase that were made on the rent rather
that just to go on the attack against the councillors
no i think at that time we never thought in that fashion
that the community at the time had a complaint with regard to the rent
hikes and that’s what led to lucky’s death because the community police
or the government police were assaulted with regard to the rent hikes
and would you then say that member of the black cats were
they not part of the community of the township 
i wouldn’t know the origins of the black cats where their
members each came from and what i can tell you is that lucky was not
really involved in politics but at times the children would be fetched
from the houses and they would be taken to certain places and they would
be called soldiers and they would say that they were going to fight the
black cats in protecting the community i didn’t know the origins of the
conflict as to what caused the whole conflict
was lucky a student at the time 
and i understood you therefore to say that some of those
people were the students themselves that is the comrades if i
understood you well that it’s the comrades who were hunting down the
black cats were they students that is were they students in 
yes they were all scholars or students and even in the
members of the black cats there were certain students
what did you think mrs nkosi about the involvement of
students in this kind of situation of confusion that’s just to explain
it was a very tense situation but it was inevitable for the
youths especially the males to get involved in fighting the gangsters in
trying to protect the community or in a quest to protect innocent
members of the community and he did not do this voluntarily they used to
be fetched at times from their homes to go and fight
when i asked this question it’s not that i’m not sympathetic
or feeling towards the loss of lucky that is by the family i’m just
trying to show the kind of situation that doctor randera has just
referred to how confused our situation was and that at this stage there
is the need for people to come to a very constructive situation on the
bones sorry to say that on the bones of our children like lucky so
that is why i want to say that at this stage you have just come to
discover through some rumours that nkosi is the person who killed your
is there any way where we can be assisted to trace nkosi 
do you have nkosi’s address also 
i heard rumours that he went to germiston because after the
matter had been finalised nkosi was discharged from the hospital he was
at extension i think his son took him and his presently staying with
his son in germiston but i don’t have his address or further details with
we may need your assistance in that thank you i have no
thank you mr manthata i’ll ask the rest of the panel russel
mrs nkosi just one you said the matter was finalized does
that mean there was a court case or an inquest 
we went to court the matter was brought before court and we
were told by the detectives my husband went there nkosi was present but
when the case was dealt with there was evidence that there was not enough
evidence against nkosi that he’s the one who killed my son he was
therefore acquitted because they said my husband didn’t have tangible
evidence for nkosi to be convicted for the murder of my son and there was
an allegation that my husband was not an eye witness he therefore could
not give the court any tangible evidence with regard to my son’s death
but they said if we wanted to take the matter further we could do that
but we didn’t see any need for us to do that because lucky had died and
we were not going to raise him up
mrs nkosi i’d just like to confirm and ask you to give a few
more details about yourself because you mention now being shot in the
no i did not say that i said lucky was shot on the hand he
was shot on the leg or foot mpeni came to explain to us that when he
mpeni was shot lucky was also shot when he looked he saw lucky falling
and at that time he looked at the direction from which the bullet came
and he saw nkosi therefore he said nkosi shot lucky whilst under the
car nkosi was hiding under the car and mpeni was shot i’m not the one
thank you very much for clearing that up yes i would also
like to thank you as i have the other witnesses who’ve come forward
because i think what you were telling us you were telling us the story
from within the community and it’s only in that way that we can begin to
understand what happened and people generally can begin to try and work
out ways of preventing that from happening you’ve suffered very badly as
a family in losing your son and we would like to offer our condolences in
that matter i would actually there’s a question in the statement which
you made and i think that your reply worth’s it bears repeating because
when you were asked how the commission should advise the president’s
office to help the community you say and i think it’s very wise what
you say you say that the commission should help and educate the
community leaders especially ministers of religion and help them towards
peace and i don’t think that’s there’s any better way of thanking you and
sending forward the message that you have in fact brought to us and to
the commission i’d like to thank you very much for doing that thank you
ladies and gentlemen at this stage we’ll break for tea take an half an

thank you very much you may sit down
mrs kgalema i would like to welcome you here today thank you
for coming and thank your daughter for coming with you you are witbank
from the old location in witbank what you’ll be telling us about is the
incident that took place in april sorry if you could please
in your own time and in your own words tell us what happened thank you
on the sixth of april i was on my way from the slagpale
butchery i had sent jabu to the shop to buy milk and bread after being
in the house for a few minutes i saw two children running telling me
that jabu has been shot i left the house just to check where he was
shot i met a car by the gate which was driven by a boy named bafana he
was talking to another person i told them not to get out of the car but
to take me to the hospital when i arrived at the hospital he had been
admitted he was then transferred to colourform hospital in pretoria two
white policeman came there whilst we were still at the hospital jabu was
unconscious in hospital for five days thereafter he was brought home
already paralyzed he has been paralyzed for ten years for the whole of
those ten years he has not been feeling well there was some things
coming out of his nose in mar ‘ he died when we woke up in the
morning he was dead when we took him for the postmortem i requested a
paper but they told me that i should pay three hundred rand for that
document the document from the postmortem that was all i didn’t hear
ma kgalema could i ask a few questions please just take your
time feel relaxed i know it must be very difficult could you take us
back to the time that he was shot and explain firstly what was actually
happening why were the police on the streets at the time
it was during the unrest when children were fighting in the
what was the cause of the fights do you know
i don’t know but it was during those times of unrest
i think we need to if we could just get absolutely clear jabu
at that state must have been aged ten or eleven
yes he was ten years old policemen and soldiers were just
roaming in the streets chasing the children around there was some random
shooting i was also involved in those shootings i even have those scars
can you hear all right through the earphones
was there any particular point to the activity at that stage
where there any particular protests taking place at the time
it’s difficult to explain because i’m not so sure about it
but i mean for a ten year old boy he couldn’t have been
politically involved would you agree on that
he was not politically involved actually i had sent him to
buy milk and bread when he got shot everything fell down so we cannot
tell what was happening what the police meant to do by shooting such a
do you know of other children who were shot at the time
there are some but i’m not so sure of their ages there were
some children that were shot during those years ‘ and many other years
but i cannot remember them the problem is i always concentrate on the
pains that i have suffered so i’ve forgotten all about other children
were the other children be about the same age or older
and jabu himself what exactly were the injuries that he
sustained you say he was shot twice
he was shot in the head above the eye and in the stomach
and was it the second of the shots in the stomach that
according to my observation the one that gave him problems
was the gunshot in the head because he kept on bleeding from the nose
time and again he had to visit verwoerd hospital in pretoria in order for
was there any particular treatment that they gave him at the
yes he was given treatment they inserted pipes which
did they operate at all in the head
i don’t know because it was not explained to me when i
asked whether the bullet was taken out they told me it was at a delicate
point if they tried to remove it he would die even after it was taken
out i was not told whether it was taken out or whether they just left it
what happened to him at home in the ten years after that how
those ten years were very difficult for him i had to take
care of him on a full time basis because mentally he was affected and you
could feel that his behaviour changed completely he was even stealing
from people and then running in the streets i was powerless i didn’t
even have money to take him to the doctor but i tried my level best to
give him the best treatment that i could
how was he able to run in the streets if you say his left leg
he was limping actually his left arm and leg were paralyzed
but he was able to walk
could i ask you you handed in a documents here which was a
letter from a lawyer which indicates that in july that’s more than
a year after the incident you were trying to or your husband was trying
to lay some charges could you give us details about that please
when we came back from verwoerd hospital my husband said we
should go and see the lawyer we went there trying to lay a claim
because of the age of the child who was shot unnecessarily we had hoped
that the lawyer would assist us or give us advice on what we should do
they asked us to pay a deposit we withdrew it and came back he wrote us
a letter telling us that he wants more money so we sent the amount of
three hundred rand after sending that money we didn’t understand what
was happening because we didn’t get any followup he didn’t come back to
us neither did we go to court nor did he call us that’s how the case
came to an end until today we just accepted that those were the
difficult times we just thought maybe if you are a black person your
things don’t go your own way the correct way
am i correct in saying that you tried in you tried then
to get compensation could i ask how you find this lawyer who introduced
we got a friend of ours who assisted us and who referred us
to the lawyers with the hope that our child should be assisted because we
really did not know how we should assist him
this was a lawyer in pretoria
and because you weren’t able to pay or you did in fact pay a
and in the same way after your son died last year you
couldn’t get the postmortem because you didn’t have the money to pay for
yes we couldn’t because we were preparing for the funeral
did anyone tell you what was in the postmortem
no nobody we tried to ask the policeman the white
policeman there we just wanted to know what the cause of his death was
because when we woke up he was dead they told us his lungs couldn’t just
stop because his problem was with the head that was the response from
so you think there was a very direct link between the original
incident when he was shot and the fact that he finally died
yes i think there was a connection that’s why i was not
satisfied i could see that he was damaged in the head what i fail to
understand is that even if my child is dead i still cannot get the truth
surrounding his death really i cannot understand it and i cannot come
he must have been twenty one when he died ma
he was going to turn twenty one in july
mrs kgalema just for our records how do you spell you name
your surname with a kg or just a g because i see the correspondence from
the lawyers is kgalema galima we would like to have the correct
spelling of your name for our records and i just want to make sure
should we check this with you later
kgalema just a second question also referring to that letter
of the lawyers to me it sounds from the deposit that you’ve paid as if
they were seeking legal aid indeed in the last paragraph they are
saying to you in afrikaans if you cannot get your hands on the
necessary fund for the deposit please come and see us urgently so that
the writer can make an appointment to arrange for legal aid support for
your case i would suggest somehow i’m not sure whether we will have the
resources to follow this up but i would suggest that you make contact
with the lawyers again to find out what happened with the case because if
they indeed did issue summons they would still be able to pursue the
case i’m just bringing your attention to that aspect thank you
i would like to take you back for clarification in your
statement you stated that the person you referred to as bafana who is
said to have shot the boy is an unknown man according to your statement
you stated that he is a neighbour this bafana you stated that he is an
unknown man but during that time he refused because it during the
even the lawyer indicated that we should bring him along to
give evidence but he refused because during that time they feared for
their lives even now we tried to talk to him but he refused to come and
stand in front of the commission he was also a witness to the two kids
mine and one of another family we know him but he refuses to come
the one was he injured at that time
no if i’m not mistaken he got injured in when the
what happened because it seems that in most cases he was a
it’s difficult to tell because when it happened to my child
it was near to his home and he knew him the shop was nearer to bafana’s
another thing you state that it was during the stayaway
what is the explanation that bafana gives
he just told us that he found him lying on the ground he
does it ever happen in the township that a person gets shot
and then there are no people to witness the incident
during that time it was possible because almost everyone
was running away for his or her safety it was very difficult
the last question can you please try to explain to us what
let to his mental disturbance that is after the shooting can you just
explain the changes of his condition
at times you would think that maybe he understood you when
you were talking but he would just come back and ask what did you say i
could see that there was something wrong he was sort of forgetful most
of the things that he was doing you would doubt it would seem as if
he’s a young child and as a parent you know your child you know the
changes within your child you could tell that this is not what my child
towards the end of his life can you just explain because it
seems as if there is something that you are suspecting regarding his
death was he not with you during that time
he was at home but as an adult he was staying in his own
bedroom when we slept he was okay but in the morning when i went to see
him i found that he was dead he hadn’t said anything nor had he
indicated that something was wrong he used to complain that it seemed
that there were things falling from his head
mrs kgalema i just want to ask two questions the first one
is for clarification earlier on when you were speaking to my colleague
mr lewin you said there was unrest in the township the children were
fighting in the street with the police we have heard this said so many
times can you tell us what the elders were doing what were the parents
doing while this was going on in the streets
it’s difficult to answer that question concerning the
adults i was coming from the butchery i was coming from the abattoirs
so i didn’t know whether there was something that had taken place during
the day while i was away from home
thank you ma’am my second question is related to the mandate
of the commission which is to do with recommendations we have to make
recommendations to the government you are someone who for ten years
looked after somebody your son who was disabled both physically and
mentally i have no doubt in my own mind that there are hundreds of other
young people and parents like yourself who are also looking after
disabled young people from the conflicts of our past are there things
that you would like to actually tell us that we could recommend to the
government which will assist these parents and young people in the
future who have the disabilities that your son had i’m sure it could
not have been very easy looking after somebody
it’s not been very easy for me as you can see this is not
my body my health has deteriorated
is there anything else you want to add mrs kgalema ma’am
it’s okay if you don’t want to say anything else it’s fine mrs kgalema
thank you for coming first of all i just want to apologize to you
because at the beginning i said your son was still alive but paralyzed
our notes don’t indicate that he had passed away and i’m very sorry for
any offence i may have committed
when i submitted my statement he had already died
thank you we’re very sorry to hear that your son died thank
you very much for coming and telling us today what happened to him we
hope that you get strength from what happened today and that you get
stronger as the days and years go by thank you very much this would be
an appropriate time to stop for tea we’ll come back at twelve o’clock
could i ask roselyna magqagqa to come to the witness stand
please good day to you mama magqagqa and welcome i’ll ask mr tom
manthata to assist you with your statement will you please raise your
right hand to take the oath do you swear the testimony which you’ll give
will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me
thank you mama you are also coming to speak to us about the
bucket protest which we’ve just heard about and your son boetie enock
who was killed during that protest i’m now going to hand you over to mr
manthata who’s going to assist you thank you
mrs magqagqa roselyna we welcome you feel at home can
you please tell us how you make a living are you working 
i’m not working but i do get a pension from deba
it’s my old age pension i never got any money from where i
have you got any sons or daughters 
i have a son as well as a daughter and my son has got a
she’s also got her own place at mandla and i’m left with my
son who is on my left
is your son working the one on your left
can you tell us about this incident when your son enock was
i do not have much to say in connection with how he was
shot because i was not present at that moment all that i know is that
enock was shot fatally i received a telephone call from the hospital
that my son was at the hospital when i enquired what had happened i was
told that he had been shot and he had died that’s all that i can furnish
was there never any inquest into the death of boetie 
no i’ve never seen a policeman at my place nor was there
any investigation no policeman came to my place
at the time didn’t the civic or whatever group come to your
no the only people who came to me came the following day
after the incident afterwards i went to the hospital to find out what
had happened and when i got to the hospital i was told that he was at the
mortuary i went to the mortuary to identify him and i came back home
on the day of burial didn’t the people who were organizing
the marches come to offer help of some kind 
yes there were people who came to assist me with regard to
the burial and the comrades were also present and there were also women
who might have been from the women’s league or from different societies
could all these people not help you to get a legal defence 
how old was boetie at the time of his death 
if i’m not mistaken he was twenty eight years old
did he have his own family 
no but he had a girlfriend who bore his baby they were
i understand you to say that he was supporting you and the
baby and even the lady that he had not married yet
no he hadn’t yet started maintaining his child because we
so you maintain that you were the only person that he was
yes i could say that because his father had died by then
he was working at claasen’s place i don’t know whether
it’s a company or a partnership
what did the firm do for him 
mama magqagqa you say in your statement that you don’t know who
shot your son and you would like to know who shot your son according to
the testimony of the previous witness and also according to other
statements given by people who were also involved in this protest said
that the councillor at the time shot randomly at the crowd who were
gathering outside his place and who were protesting and demonstrating
did you not hear anything about that that it could have been one of the
bullets from the councillor who was shooting into the crowd that killed
your son were you ever told anything 
no i never heard anything about that
did you ever have an occasion to discuss with the previous
witness who says that he was together with your son mr mnisi when this
councillor shot at them enock jafta 
no i’ve never had an opportunity to speak to him this is
the very first time that i’ve heard about my son’s death and i thank him
for come forward to explain to me how my son died it’s the very first
time that i heard how he died
maybe we can ask our staff our briefers later today to arrange
for you to actually speak to mr mnisi just to get more information do
what i’d like to explain to this commission is that my
mother is quite forgetful when my brother was shot i was with him as
well as mr mnisi who has just testified before this commission and even
when i came back from the hospital i explained to my mother how my
brother died and that he was at the hospital i also told her that he had
been shot when i explained to my mother she said she’d already received
a telephone call telling her that my brother had already died they also
requested me to take my brother’s clothes with and i refused because i
thought he would need clothes when he gets discharged i left the clothes
and i think by then he was dead but they were scared to tell me with
regard to help from the community is that we ran away afterwards because
the police were looking for us when i came back home on a thursday just
before the funeral i discovered that there were some people collecting
money ten rand from each house in order to help us meet with the funeral
expenses they said we were not going to be able to conduct the funeral
service because it would constitute having an illegal gathering we tried
to negotiate and make decisions as to how we were going to bury my
brother since we were prohibited from doing so i met the people who were
collecting the money the donation was five hundred rand which helped us
with the funeral expenses that is how the community contributed towards
my brother’s funeral as to the shooting itself according to the
programme we were going to take the buckets and spill the feces at the
administration block and then we would proceed to the councillors’
houses after we had spilled the feces at the administration block we
explained to the comrades that we were proceeding to the councillors’
houses because there were a lot of boycotts that were going on as well as
taxi boycotts but we wanted to put more pressure on the local council
there was a certain woman whose son was also involved we boycotted her
son’s taxis i think at that time my brother who has just testified was
talking to the councillor or the late councillor trying to reason with
him not to use his firearm he told us that the councillor wanted to
shoot us and three minutes thereafter we saw one of the people who were
involved coming to report to us that the councillor had already shot
quite a number of people and he was firing randomly somebody told me to
try and get some transport to take my brother to the hospital i went to
check and saw that he had been shot in the right eye there were two more
people who were shot i organized some transport to take them to the
hospital my mother is quite forgetful and she’s not able to explain what
happened because at that time she was in a state of confusion because of
my father’s death as well as my brother’s death
thank you very much for clarifying that for us what happened
after the death of your brother was this matter ever taken any further 
there was an investigation after my brother’s death i can
say that the very same day that i came back from the hospital i
contacted the chairman of the local anc branch after i got home i could
not get hold of him because the police had already started arresting
people and i was only able to see them in the evening around about seven
pm i explained to them what had happened to my brother as well as other
comrades we were not able to meet and talk because some of our members
had been arrested and insofar as my brother is concerned i don’t
remember any investigation taking place i was told that the
investigating officer said he wanted people or the person who gave them
a directive to take the buckets and throw them at the administration
block the investigation was one sided it was with regard to who
instructed the people to have this march and not who killed my brother
the councillor who was killed do you have any idea as to how he
was eventually killed did you hear anything 
the information that i have in my possession is what i’ve
been told by people who saw they said they chased the councillor but at
that time i was confused because i was trying to get some transport for
my brother to take him to the hospital as he was still breathing at that
time as well as mnisi so i organized transport to take them to the
hospital thereafter i went and followed the crowd that was running after
the councillor they were quite a distance from me and i was not able to
catch up i turned around and went back to the hospital when i came back
from the hospital i tried to find out what happened i will not be able
to mention this person’s name that is the person who told me what
happened when i was at the hospital i met this comrade and i told this
comrade that my wish was that if the councillor was arrested i wish that
he would be taken to the police because i did not want him to be killed
that’s when i knew that he had been killed they rand after him but i
discovered how he was killed when i got home i will not say who arrested
him or affected a citizen’s arrest on the councillor he was handed over
to the comrades and they took him back to the place where the march
started there was a strong police presence at that time they started
assaulting the councillor and as they were assaulting him one policeman
intervened when they wanted to burn the dead body of the councillor i am
not able to release or give the full details as to how he died to you
because i was not present at that particular moment the police who were
there trying to intervene as well as other people will be able to furnish
more information with regard to the councillor’s death
this councillor did he have a family as well 
the first time i met him he was alone i’ve never met his
family but i do think he does have a family but i cannot say for certain
whether he was married or not
so you don’t know what kind of relationship there was between
the community and the family of this councillor after this incident 
i wouldn’t know much about that but what i knew was about
him personally and that on a particular friday that was the friday
before the march i went to ask the members of the organization how the
councillors were responding to they imminent boycott i heard that they
had approached him and he was quite understanding to the plight of the
people and he was able and willing to help the members of the community
i don’t know what turned him against the community thereafter because he
had quite a wonderful relationship with the members of the community i
don’t know where the conflict started and how
since this incident has there been any contact of relationship
between your family and the family of the councillor 
as i’ve already said my mother is quite a homely person
she always remains indoors at home but according to my own observation
the relationships never improved and they were owing each other money i
discovered that later when i was told by me sisterinlaw that there was
somebody who was owed money and they said this person my brother killed
that woman’s brother and as a result she wouldn’t be able to recover the
money apparently i was told that that lady was the sister of the
deceased councillor what i know is that my brother never killed anyone
i personally think that these statements conflict and at times i get
these funny remarks so i think the relationships are not really good
you may have seen on the programme of witnesses who are going to
ge appearing later today there will be a family member of the
councillor who was killed coming to testify before the commission to
speak about their understanding of what happened if the family members
of the councillor who was killed are willing how would you feel if the
truth commission tries to facilitate some meeting so that there can be
some discussion if the other family was willing how would you feel
what i can say is even though it’s difficult for me to say
as to how i would react because i don’t know whether the other party is
willing to meet us but from my own side i believe that it is a wonderful
idea for us to get together and speak we don’t have any aim to kill
anyone or to spill any blood so i believe if we meet and explain to each
other what our objectives were at that time of leading the march and they
can also tell us their own viewpoint with regard to the march that took
place that day maybe we can reach an understanding between the two
thank you very much for that honest answer as i said we
will be hearing from the sister and we will also be hearing from other
people who were involved in that bucket protest which was very tragic and
claimed a number of lives it’s also tragic that the circumstances at the
time should have turned people against each other these were people who
lived in one community who were part of a community who knew each other
as the previous witness said he and the councillor who was killed were
actually friends they played together in a soccer team and it’s
particularly tragic that a political system which is imposed on people
where people don’t actually have the choice of themselves democratically
voting people onto councils but have a councillor imposed upon them
that that causes this division within the community it causes these
deep antagonisms hatred even and in the end leads to this kind of tragic
event we hope that maybe at the end of these hearings when we’ve had a
chance to hear the testimony of the family of the councillor that maybe
a better understanding can be reached maybe as you have said the
families can actually get together and try and understand the different
viewpoints they had at the time and see if there can be some resolving of
these long standing tensions and these divisions which caused all of this
bitterness thank you very much and from our side as the commission if
we can assist in any way to facilitate this process then we would
certainly want to do that but only if it is a request from all the
families we don’t want to impose anything on anybody it’s for the
families to decide if it’s something they want to do just for the
record can you just give us your name
thank you very much william and thank you very much to your
you can will you be speaking in english or zulu 
fine thanks very much for coming before asking doctor ally to
lead you in your evidence i would ask tom manthata please to swear you
can you raise up your fine good can you swear that the
evidence you are going to give here will be the truth and nothing else
but the truth so help me god
doctor ally could you please lead 
welcome madoda the events which you are going to relate to us
is also part of this conflict that we’ve been hearing about so much
today the conflict between on the one side the black cats and then the
other side the comrades and you were caught up in that conflict
yourself i’d like you to just tell us your experience and what happened
it was on the th of july on sunday at umzulu street there
was a conflict one of the leaders of the black cats was shot in that
confusion one of my brothers who wasn’t there went to the scene where
there was shooting and one of the leaders of black cats was shot he
tried to help zwee by taking the watch from his wrist and he was going to
report to the black cats that he has been shot one person by the name of
boblina came to our house to tell us that zwee has been shot and he’s
dead thereafter they went to tell the black cats and the black cats came
to our house to investigate the matter to find out what happened to zwee
the black cat thought zwee had been betrayed by bob they tried to ask us
a lot of questions but we didn’t know anything the following monday they
came to tell us that it’s possible they might come back to attack us on
that monday they never came back to attack us
	on the th of july it was on tuesday we were sitting at home with the
family and we were discussing family matters it was in the evening
while sitting there the deceased bob’s mother heard a knock at the door
the front door when she went to investigate she could see that this
might be the people she tried to ask them as to who they were one of
them answered saying he’s themba it was so confusing and we just kept
quiet they started kicking the door i wasn’t sure whether they shot at
the door or whether they hacked with a panga as we used to call the
deceased kohli and we asked why do you have to close the door while we
were still there two people entered the house one of them was wearing a
balaclava and he shot he pointed at the deceased with a firearm and they
asked where bob was and we told them bob was not at home they took us
and put us into the deceased room they were taking the mother throughout
all the rooms trying to search for bob and we really told them that we
didn’t know where bob was therefore they continued their rounds
searching the house with bob’s mother she tried to lead them or bribe
them and she called someone by the name of kanage as she was a shabeen
queen she tried to persuade them not to do what they wanted to do she
tried to give them some money they took the money and everything and
indistinct it together they switched off the lights in the room where
we were they took bob’s mother to the kitchen and when they arrived at
the kitchen they shot her it was so late and dark
	they ran away and they were shooting as they were running away we
didn’t see when the grenade was thrown at us because it was dark as i
was running away from that incident as i was trying to run i happened to
step on top of the grenade it exploded i discovered waking up lying on
the bed and i was oozing blood i couldn’t walk and i was confused the
people were also confused they even offered to go and see what happened
to bob’s mother i asked them to go and find out how she was they also
tried to attack the front room but they failed most of the people ran
away and i was left alone because i couldn’t walk
	later when i talked to my mom i called her and told her it looks like
i’m going to die i asked her to take me to my place just to take me to
my home and i crawled when i arrived at my grandma’s place i felt that
i was going to die on the road therefore i crawled next to one
neighbour the neighbour took me into the house and i asked the neighbour
to try the next neighbour to ask the neighbour next door to take me to
hospital she said she’s afraid because there was fighting outside she
couldn’t they tried to go and make a call they called for an ambulance
after that i couldn’t remember what happened because i’ve got some
problem in remembering things i’ve have some pains on my feet and all my
trousers were torn and i thought i’m going to be cripple at that time
they took me on an ambulance to hospital i stayed in hospital for about
two months i would say that the black cats working in collaboration with
the police searched for bob and they found him together with my brother
they were suspecting there were people who knew exactly what happened on
zwee i don’t know as to how the trial lasted but they went to court and
they ended up winning the case and that’s where it ends
thank you madoda your own injuries as a result of what happened
when your house was attacked do you are you still suffering from the
after effects of that injury what is your health like presently 
i would say it’s so persistent at the moment because firstly
i would like to say that i grew under the hands of bob’s mother and this
incident put me in a situation where i’m in great sorrow because i don’t
what to do for the children at the moment and my legs also cold and i
always like to feel like going outside where it’s sunny to stay and
were you still at school at the time that this happened 
what were you doing at that time 
i used to work with the deceased’s mother trying to help her
and presently what do you do 
at the moment i’m not doing anything
do you still receive any medical help are you on any
madoda this conflict between the black cats and the comrades
what is your understanding of what this conflict was about it claimed
so many lives that led to people dying in such horrible circumstances
can you share with us how you understood what was going on 
i would say that it started long ago during the anticrime
campaign and trying to help the community against people who robbed the
people in the community i discovered i wasn’t in the location but when
i arrived i was told that there’s conflict in the location it’s not
about the anticrime campaign anymore it’s now the black cats fighting
against the comrades and the civics
this anitcrime campaign do you have any idea when it began 
when it started more or less 
it started during while the people were fighting for
and you yourself did you join any political grouping were you
involved in any way politically in the township in the community 
now the other thing about this conflict is often there are
accounts of people shooting with firearms guns hand grenades were the
black cats generally armed did they have weapons most of the time 
the black cats were working in collaboration with the police
because most cases where they were to attack the comrades the policemen
would be running in front of the black cats
and the comrades did they also have arms did they have guns 
i will put it like this i don’t know much about them being
armed with firearms because they normally defended themselves with pangas
and is it true that the comrades would often also attack people
who they believed to be members of the black cats 
no the comrades to attack it was because the black cats
started attacking the comrades before the comrades realized that they
won’t stand for this and they have to protect themselves
i know you spoke about the police and saying that they
collaborated with the black cats but did the community the comrades
did they make attempts to go to the police to report on the activities of
these socalled black cats do you have any knowledge of that 
yes we the comrades used to go to the police but the police
apparently in the last few days in july just before there
was an attempt by police to try and bring these two groups together to
bring the youth who were seen as comrades and to bring the socalled
black cats or karate’s was the other name used to try and get them to
resolve their differences do you know about this meeting that the police
tried to call late in july 
do you know of any attempts which the police made to try and
bring these groups together to try and bring about some resolution of
as i’ve explained before i don’t know much about that
and this zwee zwane did you know him 
and was he a leading member of the black cats 
was he a member of the black cats was he seen as a leading
and how was he killed do you know what did you hear about
i heard from others that he has been killed and i don’t know
and how was he killed were you told that did you hear
perhaps if he was shot stabbed what 
it looks like it has subsided
what are relationships like now in what’s the relationship like
between people who perceive to be on the one side and those on the other
yes it looks peaceful because comrades can go any place in
the township and we live in peace
and are there still people who were members of what was then
called the black cats who still live in the community 
and are they also safe and would you say that they also
consider themselves to be quite safe do they feel safe as well in the
it looks like that they seem to be safe too
and you personally by coming to the commission what are you
hoping for what were your reasons for making this statement and coming
it was because i was so badly injured i thought maybe the
commission might do something to help me personally
thank you doctor ally tom madoda could i ask you you say
you’re unemployed at the moment is that correct 
do you have any particular skills that you have developed
yourself which might get you some sort of employment 
i don’t have any particular skill at the time before i used
to sing i was a musician but not any more since the event because i
have you thought of trying perhaps of trying to find something
like that to develop you singing skills 
the way i was injured i was a drummer but i don’t see myself
making it in that area anymore since this event
have you approached anyone about the possibility of some sort
and i mean have you spoken to anyone about the need that you
obviously have which you’ve expressed yourself about how to get over
this harsh experience have you approached anyone for counselling for
i think that’s something that we would recommend that you do i
think i would like to in thanking you for coming forward i think what
you have something unique to tell you have your own story which is very
unique and a very strong part of that story is that as you put it you
thought you were going to die when you stood on this grenade that is
something that is both very terrifying and at the same time must somehow
give you strength because you survived an attack which could have killed
you you were in a situation in this conflict between for instance
between the cats and the comrades you were in a position where you could
have died is that not so others died around you and you have survived
that which must be a great source of relief on the one hand but also of
strength so i think what we would in thanking you for coming and in
thanking you also as you say you’ve come forward to make sure the people
know what happened and to see whether we can help we can help but
perhaps i think the more important thing is that you can help yourself
and what we would urge you to do is to start doing that because people
will look up to you you’re still a very young person you have talents
you need to develop those talents you need also to seek help from the
community to ask how you can develop it certainly we will investigate
the possibility that there might be for you but we’d like in thanking
you i’d like to say you know use the strength that you have that you
have shown in coming forward and having survived that attack thank you
can i welcome the right reverend bishop inkomishi from the
catholic church welcome to you sir good morning ma’am can you first
tell us is it mrs faku or fako
faku thank you mrs faku welcome would you please
introduce the people who are with you this morning
this is my sister this is the deceased child behind me
welcome to all of you mrs faku you too are from witbank
you’re taking us back to when elsie nonhlanhla faku was shot and
died subsequently miss hlengiwe mkhize is going to be helping you as you
tell your story but before you do that can i ask mr malan to help you
with taking the oath please can you stand
mrs faku will you please swear that the evidence you will be
giving will be the truth and only the truth say so help me god
thank you very much please be seated
mrs faku we welcome you can you hear me
i would like you to explain you story please feel free the
commissioners will help you to give your evidence as the chairman has
already mentioned you are here to talk about your daughter nonhlanhla
can you please tell us her age as well as whether or not she was
politically involved at the time just give us a picture of what kind of
she was about seventeen years old she had a child and this is
the child behind me this child was one year old at the time i don’t
know much about her political involvement because sometimes you might or
might not know about your children’s’ involvement at their early ages i
was at work when i came back from work some people came towards me and
told me that nonhlanhla has been injured i asked then where she was
they said she was at doctor kani i said that the doctor will take care
of her and if she is seriously injured the doctor might take her to
you can take off the earphones
i said to them doctor kani will take her to hospital if she is
seriously injured my younger sister came not the one presently with me
and said we better go and visit her and i told her that i’m still waiting
for my husband because he used to knock off past five later we went to
doctor kani when we arrived we found her lying on the floor doctor
kani and his wife were at the surgery when they wanted to take her to
hospital we were told she died i picked her up to see how she was
injured when i tried to let her sit she started crying and the blood
was oozing through her nostrils she was vomiting blood we also saw some
substances in the blood as the blood was oozing from her back as well
they held her my husband looked at her but he did not feel well and had
to get outside later he came back and the police arrived they took her
to the mortuary after that we started making arrangements for the
funeral we thought we would bury her on friday but we decided to do it
on saturday we managed to after the funeral we had to get a lawyer from
the government who helped us and we didn’t pay anything we went to
court the court hearing lasted for about two days and the police denied
that they shot her we went to the mortuary and they investigated or
they did something like a postmortem and they discovered that she still
had some cartridge substances in the body
thank you for your story in order to help you give us a
clear picture of the story i’m going to ask you some questions as you
said you were called by one lady to tell you that your daughter is in
hospital in your statement it’s written that children were stopped from
going to school by the police on that particular day briefly explain to
us what was happening at that time
i don’t know because i was at work i didn’t know that the
children were stopped from going to school but i will say that it was the
time that police were running around the location
when you arrived at the surgery there were many children
do you remember how many children were at the surgery and
what was their condition do you know if any people died and if so how
i think there were three that died on that particular day one
of them was mine the diani child died at her home because they passed
shooting she was hit and died i would say there were three who died on
that particular day the others were just being attended to by the doctor
i would like to ask you some further questions in order to
get a clearer picture as to the situation and the time she got shot you
said you are not sure about the children who were involved themselves in
demonstrations however if something happened in a township there’s
normally a rumour i’d like to find out whether you yourself ever heard
any rumours from the community regarding what was happening were there
children singing were they fighting was there some stone throwing
after such incidents there should be some rumours
i heard that the children were marching and she was also in
their company and that’s when she got shot i wasn’t there personally
maybe if you try to remember the way in which you buried
her did the people tell us about the people who came to the funeral
was it attended by the fellow comrades who were also involved in the
i would say there were many children at the funeral because
when we were transporting her to the funeral there were so many people
that we had some taxis and buses conveying the people i would say there
maybe i should take you back to what they said was there
any conflict between the police and the children or was it just the
police who were marching around and shooting at the people
i didn’t hear anything about that i just saw the children who
were injured i don’t know what was happening at the scene i was also so
confused that i couldn’t think much about that because it was such a
maybe you can further explain to us about the court case
did you get any help from political organizations or from the south
no we didn’t get any help we were working closely with one of
the lawyers provided by the legal aid
what was the main aim what was the problem you said you
had to exhume the body of the child what was the problem
yes we were not in agreement some people said they didn’t
shoot or find the child so the court said we have to exhume the body in
order to investigate further it’s then that they had to find the other
after she was exhumed and it was discovered that she was
shot did you have any progress in the matter
in your statement you said someone agreed that he shot her
when did that happen was it in court
yes it was in court there were twelve policemen and the
eleventh one said i did shoot the child twice
did the court try to help you by asking questions as to why
he gave evidence that the child was holding a hand grenade and
the prosecutor asked him how was she holding this hand grenade he
couldn’t explain after investigating everything it found that he wasn’t
injured in any way that could show any sign of a hand grenade having
exploded so it couldn’t be proved that she had a hand grenade
i would like to thank you i’ll hand you back to the
chairperson maybe the other commissioners could help you by asking some
mrs faku in your statement and also in your evidence here you
say when you met with your child in the hospital on the floor she was
bleeding all over and that she had many wounds can you just again tell
us about those wounds and the nature of them
there were just holes bullet holes
but you say there were many holes
yes all over the body from the top of the shoulders at the
back there were holes big holes
can you tell us how many holes you saw can you remember were
there a lot of were there a few i’m sorry that i’m asking this very
difficult question but you tell us that the policeman said he shot her
only two times did you see more holes than two holes
there were many holes as i’ve explained before they were
stretching right from the shoulders down to the buttocks
do you have any closer information for us as to perhaps a case
number or who the policeman was was it a criminal case or was it an
inquest do you have any documentation at home that we can look at
i no longer have those papers but there is this white man who
was the investigating officer from pretoria i just forgot his name
once you remember the name i would be very pleased if you
could tell one of our people so that we can contact the individual to
find out really what other information is available to us thank you no
mrs faku could i just take you back to what you said about the
situation in the township at the time and where you mention that there
were a lot of police running around the township were there other people
being killed were there instances either of police being killed or of
councillors being killed at the time that you know of
i don’t remember but things were bad in the township there
were a lot of police and soldiers patrolling the township
we’re just trying to get to the background as to why there was
that police presence there why had they come into the township
the people were furthering the struggle in the township
in what sort of way though
i was always at work so i wouldn’t know exactly what they were
but you say they were furthering the struggle can you give us
any example of what was actually happening
i personally don’t know anything as i said i was always at
work even when my child was shot i was work i only heard about her when
i was coming back from work
did the children talk at all about what they were doing
about what they were involved in in terms of quote the
i didn’t hear anything because as i said things were bad in
the township i said police were coming and going in the township so i
just to take you back you said your daughter left a one
year old daughter behind can you tell us more about this daughter how
old is she is she attending school
she’s attending school she’s the little daughter behind me
she’s doing standard five but i have some problems because i only get one
hundred rand a month and there are so many needs that i have to fulfill
considering the future however i cannot afford because at the moment
i’m not working and my husband passed away as well because he was
affected by the death of his daughter in i’m not working at the
moment so i have difficulties my granddaughter really likes schooling
but unfortunately i cannot help her
is she the one at the back between the two ladies
is she still at school what kind of a school is she at is
it a public school in the township or is it a private school in town
no she’s at vuma in the township she would have like to have
gone to town and study there but unfortunately we couldn’t afford it
because the situation is not that good as i’m not working
mrs faku is there anything else you wish to say
i would like to ask the commission if it would be possible to
 can be deciding on a policy for reparation and of
course you will before then from us but today i just want to empathize
with you on the loss of your daughter who was only seventeen years and i
can see how upset your granddaughter is behind you to have lost her
mother at such a young age she was one year of age at the time i hope
that by her coming here today she has learnt something about her mother
and what was happening here in our country at the time we will come back
to you in terms of whatever reparation is going to be possible for you
for the loss of your child thank you very much
could i ask tabita sikhosana to please come forward
can you hear me through the earphones 
mama you are also coming to speak about the very same event
the bucket protest where your son was shot and eventually died as a
result of the injuries that he sustained before i ask mr hugh lewin to
assist you i am going to ask if you would just please put up your right
hand to take the oath thank you very much thanks
mrs sikhosana can you hear i’d like to welcome you and greet
you you will have heard what the two previous witnesses have told us and
we would ask whether you in your own words can tell us about your son and
what happened to him on that day in july just take your time and in
your own time tell us thank you
i thank you on that day if my memory serves me right it
was on the seventh when i got home from the funeral i was cold because
my son had been shot by the councillor what i was told was that there
was no conflict at all there seems to be a misunderstanding here what i
know is that there was no fight or conflict at all the people only had
buckets to spill the feces into the offices and the councillors’ houses
they went to ngakane’s house that’s where my son was shot from what
i’ve heard my son was not fighting ngakane was outside with a firearm
he was approached and told that he should not start any fight i think
they were trying to negotiate with him and suddenly someone shot and he
shot back mr mgwala’s son died and nlapo survived the attack and mine
was killed he did not die straight away he died after a few months in
the hospital that was quite a difficult time of oppression what hurts
the most was when i got to the scene of the crime crying
that was quite a difficult time for us as parents miss
kumalo took me to the hospital on sunday to see my son when i got there
i discovered that my son was bleeding profusely through his nose we left
indistinct miss kumalo the police refused us entry to the hospital
we went to heidelberg office and asked the comrades there to accompany us
to the hospital when we got to the hospital they refused us entry tembi
talked to them and they eventually allowed us in when i got to his bed
i realized that the nurses did not attend to him i saw the bullet in his
neck and others were in the spinal cord when i asked him whether they
were fighting because i was told that he was already in hospital he said
we were not fighting we were only trying to get ngakane to understand
that he should not shoot because we had already finalized this matter of
the buckets i also saw that his left hand was tied to a pole on the bed
he was not attended to he could not stand up and his foot was also tied
	what hurts me the most is that my son was not fighting i’m also so hurt
about the fact that he was our breadwinner and today i’ve lost him i
don’t have my husband either what has hurt me as well is that each time
i went to the hospital they would refuse to let us see him only one
nurse allowed us in and what prompted me to go to that nurse was the way
they had bandaged him on his back it was such a fatal wound the skin
was peeling on that wound and that’s why i approached the nurse so that i
could pay attention to my son myself and attend to him personally i
asked why he was tied to the bed in this way why did they have his hand
and his foot tied onto the bed i approached the nurse so that i could
attend to him myself the police were guarding him and were continuously
insulting him 	i would like to apologize for the way i’m crying but when
i recall the whole thing it brings tears to me i can’t control myself
ma you mustn’t feel you need to apologize and if it is too
painful then don’t continue you can stop whenever you like please
thank you for that what bothered me as well was that at
that time it was a difficult time for us as a community people the
whites did not hear anything about us and they had no feeling for us at
all you know when i got to the hospital and found out that the nurses
were attending to my son i asked them to leave him so that i do the
whole thing myself because they were not doing the job patiently when
they removed the bandage they would just take it any way they wanted to
and the skin was peeling on the wound that’s why i felt i should do this
myself because i will pay much more attention i asked and they finally
agreed that i could do this he survived three months i took him with
but he could not stand up or walk or do anything i get very disturbed
when i think about the fact that he was taking care of us at home when
you take this bandage it would peel the skin and what was hurting the
most was that you could see the bullet inside they left the bullets
inside they didn’t even attempt to extract them if only they attended
to my son i think he would still have been alive today
ma maybe it would help if could just ask some questions about
what happened earlier because in your statement you tell us about his
being an activist and you say that he was in prison can you tell us
yes yes he was in prison there was this protest in the
community he was arrested on a quiet day not that they were fighting
they were only protesting and that was a hard time for us because at one
time they came at night and he was sleeping they took him and threw him
in the back of the van they were using the bbd he had is bbd on and was
not dressed properly they took him naked and threw him in the back of
the van they told me that they had given him clothes and i wanted to
know where he was and they said they didn’t know we tried to investigate
to find out where he was we tried to ask the other people as well and
they told us that our children had been sent to the modder b prison we
did not know modder b but on that day they located it we knew it and we
found them there at the modder b prison it was painful one day when i
went to modder b and i asked to see him and they told me that he was in
hospital i did not understand what sent him to hospital they did not
want to disclose any truth i asked them what happened to him and they
told me that nothing happened to him he’s just in hospital i asked them
to see my son and eventually i saw him i asked him what happened to him
and he didn’t answer back he cried and i cried as well
had he been charged or was he just being held in detention 
he was not charged they were just held in detention and
they were picking up all the youth from the location and they were
he must have been very young when he was in detention because
you say when he died he was twenty two 
that’s correct he was not that young at the time i think
why do you think the police were again trying to hold him after
he had been shot and was lying in hospital why were they protecting him
or why were they holding him 
won’t you please repeat your question
just after the incident at the councillor’s house you describe
how your son was held tied by his hand and his foot to the bed why do
you think the police were doing that 
that was done because they were called comrades as if they
were fighting and yet they were not fighting they were only protesting
and shouting that mkane must not shoot and he shot when i got to the
hospital i realized that the police were keeping guard over him and they
tied his foot and him arm onto the hospital bed
when you finally got him home they didn’t try and charge him
no they never gave us trouble they only came once and i
asked them why were they after my son because he was sick lying down he
could not run or walk they answered back and said when we come back one
day and find out that he has ran away you will be in trouble meaning
myself he never ran away he died instead they never came back since
before he died were you able to bring in a doctor or get any
yes he used to get his treatment from the hospital in
did he talk about the incident at all before he died 
no he never did that because what was commonly known in
the community was that one day there will be this bucket protest but
there was no intention of killing my son grew up in front of ngakane it
was very surprising for me to find out that he shot my son and even at
the hospital with his foot and hand chained to the hospital bed it was
surprising to me because the three of them were not fighting
ma just a last question could i just confirm that temba was
actually shot by the councillor and then was in hospital and that all
happened before the councillor was killed so temba had nothing to do with
yes he never killed the councillor temba was admitted to
hospital and the councillor was still alive then they only heard in
hospital that ngakane was killed that was after they had been admitted
ma thank you very very much i have no more questions
mama thank you very much for coming and speaking about
something that’s still very very painful as i said to the witnesses who
came before you mrs magqagqa and her son if the families actually
requested if the truth commission could assist in the families who
directly suffered as a result of what happened in july the truth
commission could assist in bringing these families together to speak
through what happened share their pain how they would feel about it i
know that it’s very painful for you but if you would maybe like to
respond to that if you don’t want to at this point that’s perfectly
okay you did say that your son grew up in front of mr japhta ngakane
how would you feel about the families meeting to discuss what happened 
i have no objection to that
thank you very much for coming mama sikhosana and reliving
that painful experience and we hope that maybe if the families do come
together that some understanding can come from that and maybe that can
help with some of the pain and some of the suffering thank you for
i would like now to call two of our earlier witnesses who have
now arrived if i could ask phumzile vilakazi please to come forward and

when i came back from work on the th of august in i
received a telephone call somebody was telling me that fanie my son
had been shot next to the shops he had been shot by a certain policeman
by the name of njomo when i went to the shops my sister came and we went
to see him at the hospital and i asked him as to what had happened he
told me that he had been shot by njomo and asked what was happening he
said he was with his uncle steko and a malindisa booi and they harassed
malindisa booi and when he intervened and asked they did not answer him
when they went away njomo shot him from the back they sent him to
kalafong hospital that’s where he was admitted he remained in kalafong
	on the th of october when i was still at work my cousin arrived
together with my other son they’d come to fetch me from work and i asked
them as to what had happened they said dingane had been shot and
admitted when i got to the hospital i found dingane with his eyes
closed he called out my name and i responded he said to me i should
give him water and the sisters prohibited me from giving him water the
nursing sisters at the hospital i went outside and i stayed outside the
following morning when we phoned johannesburg hospital they told me that
dingane died on the way to johannesburg hospital fanie stayed and he
died in on the th of january
	dingane was shot by maschilwane a cid i tried to get some legal
advice i went to prinsloo and he was going to institute civil action
against njomo but when my son died he said he could not continue with the
legal proceedings because my son had died
are you okay are you ready to answer questions sylvia 
you haven’t told us what prinsloo has to appear for which
of your sons was it for dingane or for fanie 
he said with regard to fanie
he said with regard dingane’s matter he wouldn’t be able to
help us because he died at that time with fanie’s matter it was quite
different because he took him to pretoria in one of the provincial
hospitals so that he could get a medical report as to his injuries and on
the nd of february prinsloo was supposed to go to finalise the matter
and he died before the nd of february arrived
what did you get what information did you get from the
malindi’s family children or sons who were with fanie
they said they were just asking as to what was happening
why were they harassing mike malindi so that was all they did not
fight but they tried to intervene
i don’t know where njomo is
malindi does not even know about njomo too 
i have no idea whether he knows where njomo is
was njomo a policeman or njomo was just an ordinary 
yes he was a member of the south african police
and how related what was the relation between fanie and the
malindi family were they students or were they just both youths in the
and they couldn’t know who njomo was or what the problem was
would you say that this kind of quarrel that could have been
between fanie and njomo had it any political content in it 
i have no idea but what i know is my son was a member of
the anc he was quite active within the anc
he was a student at the time 
he was working at the time
he was working was he part of the youth league or was he
just a worker with xhosa too perhaps from that level having the
it didn’t occupy any particular position he was just an
ordinary member i think a card carrying member of the anc
okay it is true that fanie died after a long period of
illness but at his death did the anc any anc constituency show sympathy
you have no idea what the youth at the time could have done
that could brought that kind of anger of njomo against them 
it’s maybe possible because at the time it wasn’t quiet in
our area there was some violence
and if i understand you well you are saying fanie used to
attend the meetings of those who were remotely or immediately involved in
the violence of the day or in the confusions of the day 
no no i’m not referring to a thug we said he was an
active anc member now i’m saying perhaps organizations that were
affiliated to anc at that time could have been involved either in a
quarrels or demonstrations against the community councillor or as it has
been hinted earlier on you know in organizing demonstrations this
i wouldn’t know whether njomo bore a grudge because at that
time he used to go out with gita and gita was an anc member or an anc
njomo used to sorry gita used go along with fanie or 
yes gita used to go along with fanie
okay and what story did gita tell you 
no gita was at work at this time we only met him at the
with dingane what happened you say there was never a
lawyer instructed to act on behalf of the family for dingane’s death 
no i never did no there was nothing
and was he a student dingane or was he working too at the
he was just fresh from prison so he was not working
and having come out of prison did he affiliate to any of the
no he was not involved in anything that took place in our
area no political organisation or a gang
so now you are left with how many children sylvia 
three these two were the eldest to those that are still
yes they were fanie was my first born and dingane was my
thank you any other questions doctor ally doctor randera 
mrs vilakazi i just want to follow up on what you said that
the police were not interested in taking a statement from you is that
yes they didn’t pay attention to what i was saying when i
but did they take a statement 
no they didn’t even want to write anything down when i
and when your lawyer mr prinsloo approached the matter
what was said by the police 
he never related to me as to what they told him but he told
me that he was taking the matter further
now fanie died almost five months later is that right oh
sorry two and a half years later can you tell us what he died of 
ever since he was shot by njomo he was sickly and he had
these sores that could not be cured
so it was a direct complication of the shooting as far as you
yes it was a direct complication because the bullets were
not extracted from his body he remained with the bullets until he died
can i just come to dingane dingane died the next day as you
say in your statement from the shooting was there an inquest was a
i was never told but they told me that he was dead on
so you were just given a death certificate by the hospital
i was never even given the death certificate they told me
that he had been sent to johannesburg and i phoned my brother to find out
more and when we phoned the johannesburg hospital we were told that he
was dead on arrival and we went to mashilwane the policeman who shot him
and we asked him to fetch him from johannesburg because we did not have
money he asked me if he was the one who was shot would i have gone to
thank you ma’am i have no further questions
phumzile thank you i’d just like to if i may to ask one or
two questions myself you mentioned that dingane was shot at his uncle’s
place just after he was released from detention can you tell us how long
at my uncle’s place not his uncle’s place
your uncle’s place how long had he been in detention and why
i wouldn’t know because i didn’t even attend the case
but was he actually charged then when he was taken into
i don’t know why he was arrested or what he was arrested
for and what he was being charged for i decided that i was not going to
attend the trial because i wanted to disassociate myself with any
criminal acts committed by my children
so you don’t think that there was any political connection 
do you now how long he was in detention 
mrs vilakazi you story is i mean you have seen the death of
your eldest son through both of them they’ve i mean the paid and the
suffering that you have had particularly in fanie’s case where he came
home and he was in a wheelchair as you described and didn’t get better
he went back to hospital was then brought home again and died so this
must have been two two and a half very terrible years for you then
dingane’s death itself was so it seems to be so senseless and so cruel
that there he is sitting he asks a question of someone who is in
authority who takes out a gun and shoots him this must be for a mother
it must be a very dreadful thing to bear and we certainly are with you in
that we will certainly follow up through the lawyer that you have
mentioned there’s so many questions that your story raises and there
must be questions that are with you all the time all i’d like to say is
that we express our sympathy to you for that we hope that the community
and the rest of your family will also stand with you and support you and
we thank you very much for coming today thank you
can i please call richard tembelikle rumo can i once more
announce that there are statement takers in the foyer if there’s anybody

richard thank you for coming today you’re taking us to
ogies my colleague next to me tells me that i have something about ogies
because whenever we talk about mpumulanga i talk about ogies so i hope
you’re going to tell us a little more about this little town of yours
which is not far from here you’re taking us to and you’re going to
be telling us about what happened to you mr hugh lewin is going to be
helping you with your story but before he does that can you please stand
to take the oath miss mkhize will help you with that thank you
do you swear that the evidence you are about to render to
this commission is the truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
mr rumo i’d like to welcome you and thank you for coming
can you explain who is with you
this is my sister celina on my left hand side
we’d like to welcome her as well thank you for coming
please feel relaxed you’re going to tell us about what happened here
within the ogies branch of the anc in and the way in which you were
threatened as well as what happened to you if you could please feel
relaxed and in your own time and your own words tell us what happened
i will explain about what happened in ogies in i was the
chairperson of ogies branch and after that i never had peace from the
police or the soldiers who used to visit ogies this even extended beyond
ogies to witbank because i was working here in witbank they would
follow me at times i would attend anc meetings in kriel or matla but
they would still follow me in their own way at times i would be leaving
matla to go back home and i’d come across a road block where i’d be
instructed to get out of the car normally i would have company in my car
and the police would cause chaos inside my car just so i would react in
some way they’d tell me that they are searching i’d proceed to go home
and they’d follow me at about two am i’d hear strange knocks on my
door and when i open the door they’d come inside and search for things
that i knew nothing about they would take anything which had the anc
	i want to talk about this particular day in kriel there was an anc
meeting and i was given the task to go and sort out things in douglas
because there would be a comrade terror lekota or chris hani who’d be
addressing the workers in douglas i agreed to go and make arrangements
regarding the catering etc so that everything runs smoothly i left my
work place on friday and i headed for that area there were two girls
with me they were my sisters children i took them home before going to
douglas i left them at home and it so happened that they left their
calculators in my car as well as my music instrument i thought i’d
leave everything at home and drove into darkness it was in may in winter
	just as i was entering douglas at about five in the afternoon at the
corner by the mine next to the hostel where i was going to make
arrangements for the meeting there was a car accident a school child
was hit by a car and lying on the ground no one was attending to this
school child so i thought i should make an effort to attend to the child
there were three policemen standing by in a car nearby and i wondered
what had happened there i was torn apart i didn’t know what to do
whether i should stop or rush to douglas i decided to proceed in order
to attend to my task i’d made all the arrangement and preparations for
the sunday meeting 	when i was going back i found out that that
accident that took place at about five it was now around seven or eight
that child was still lying there cold as it was i took it upon myself to
do something about it i stopped my car got out and went to the school
child i saw these police i don’t know what you call these gentlemen
police or security one of them had a gun and he asked me with such
venom what i wanted i told him i was coming to attend to the school
child and he told me that it’s none of my business i told him for his
information that it was part of my business because i was a teacher and
this was my responsibility he told me we had an argument which ensued
and now we had this indistinct that emanated out that
	we saw a group of people coming as well the other person went to stop
the crowd which was approaching right then the trucks approached and i
decided it best to leave the scene but on the other hand i felt that i
shouldn’t go i insisted to wait and he called his colleague and they
took me inside the car there were dogs inside the van at the back of
the van i was lost as to what was happening because i hadn’t done
anything they took me with them while i was still inside the car i saw
the other person coming to fetch the body that was lying on the ground
	we realized that the school child had died already and we saw this white
lady driving past she spoke to me in afrikaans as i don’t understand
afrikaans i struggled to understand she said this is weekend and we
are picking up black pigs i was amazed at what she said because it
seemed to be a joke to them because they started laughing i asked from
the car why are you calling this child a black pig he told me that he
had gone to my car and discovered my anc card which he brought back with
him he told me to shut my mouth and i shouldn’t say anything about this
mandela i realized that this argument was intensifying they were making
jokes of the whole scene especially regarding the girl that was lying
there the other two security chaps discussed something fortunately
only i knew how to start my car so they could not start my car they
tried to start the car but the couldn’t so they came back to me and asked
what was wrong with my car they asked me to go and start the car which
i did my hands were tied behind me and they took me to the police
	unfortunately when i got there there was a boy who attended school in
delmas and i knew him by this time it was eleven at night and he asked
me what i was doing there so i told him to ask the other guys who brought
me there that gentleman told me that he wouldn’t allow me to spend the
night there and that he would make a point of keeping me company he
tried to get a heater for me from the charge office so it could warm the
place and i could stay there he gave me his jersey because it was cold
i slept for a while and i woke up he asked me what was in my car i told
him what was in my car and he said that there was nothing left in my car
and the white policemen were busy in my car not knowing what they were
	i remembered a certain attorney by the name of omar zaire in springs i
had his telephone numbers with me and i decided to phone him and explain
the whole matter to him he made arrangements to call ogies and also come
to me at about two in the morning he did come not the lawyer but he
made arrangements that my brotherinlaw would come in the early hours of
the morning he came and i told him to take everything in my car he went
to my car and came back to tell me that there was absolutely nothing left
in my car the police refused interrupted
mr rumo sorry to interrupt we are wanting to get on to the
part in your statement where you talked about the divisions and what
happened as a result of that do you think you could get onto that now
as to that division when i left the police station the
comrades who came from paula whom i worked with in the anc branch there
was that division that they alleged that i was working with the police in
black pine i asked them what made them say that and they said that they
had no trust in me anymore because i was there in custody and i might
have had friendships with the police by virtue of being there a
statement given that there were anc members who were misbehaving and that
was broadcast on the national television and then there were those
allegations that they did not trust me anymore as their comrade they
decided that this should be publicized so that it’s known that people
from ogies are not genuine anc members they wanted everybody to know
	i thought that was minor but at one stage a comrades went to witbank
from ogies and when they got home they told me that they had come to
discuss the matters of ogies with me people were complaining in ogies
that the anc comrades were not receptive to them i asked them to come
inside the house i knew that people were not in favour of comrade
jackson because once he made mention of a certain statement on the
national television while we were still inside four comrades from the
offices came inside when they came inside they were very rude and asked
me why did i allow jackson to come especially after he had uttered those
words on the national television i tried to explain to them what
prompted him to say the things he said they then went to my late father
and instructed him to chase jackson from ogies or else they would set our
house alight my father came and insulted me and threatened 
sorry could you explain who this comrade jackson is please
comrade jackson mtembo is an anc member and he is now minister
of transport here in mpumulanga region
at the time what role did he have that brought him to you
what was he doing in ogies
at the time he was an anc national officer he came to me in
ogies so that we could discuss and address the anc comrades’ problems in
ogies as though there were people who approached him about the comrades
could you explain then to us just briefly to round up what
actually happened about this now how was it resolved or was it not
this problem was not resolved this is why i came to this
commission because i made an effort to solve the problem comrade jackson
was attacked assaulted and injured i took him to witbank and my going
back to ogies created a problem to the community of ogies even today
i’m not accepted in ogies community i’m not accepted and i’m regarded as
were you yourself attacked at all
they did try to attack me there but fortunately some people
alerted me and i managed to escape
what is your position now today do you still have an
i don’t have any official position and that has affected me
mentally as well because i’m not as effective as i used to be
this business about them claiming that you’re a police
informer did you categorically deny that
i repudiate all of that the were people were doing that but not
myself i have two names that i would like to disclose i wonder if you’d
those are the people that alleged that i am working with the
police and they were the very ones who wanted information about the anc
i think what we would need there is if you could just speak to
our statement takers afterwards and give us those names rather than in
public because the names are not in your original statement so we haven’t
been able to inform those people we need to do that as a commission so
if you could please give us those names afterwards
thank you mr lewin miss mkhize
mr rumo i just want to tell you that i’m rather confused
because your statement is already confusing and i understand that the
whole country was confused and it seems to me ogies even more than some
other areas especially through your eyes at the time and the situation
that you found yourself in unfortunately you addressed a number of
other issues which you didn’t deal with in the statement and a number of
issues you dealt with in the statement you didn’t deal with now so you
will understand if we don’t exactly follow the trend of your thoughts
may i just make sure you are saying that the main purpose why you’re
coming to us now is that you are being perceived in your community still
as some kind of informer or traitor and you want that record to be set
straight is that the main purpose of you coming to us
then just a few issues in terms of detail in the written
statement you say that you were robbed of your car how was that done
was it a criminal robbery or was it an impounding by the police or they
accuse you of carrying arms or drugs or what how did you lose the car
as you’ve said there are things that i did not submit in my
statement the car was taken in the afternoon and i was also assaulted i
have wounds on my body that was done on the road from witbank to 
they took the car and they left me in the road towards pretoria and
suddenly i lost consciousness and when i regained my consciousness i was
in hospital and i didn’t know how i got there i was told to go to the
police station after that i went to the police station and i encountered
problems when they were assaulting me that night one of the police said
they should have noticed some of the things and interrupted
i’m sorry may i interrupt you let’s not go into the other
side please just tell us about the car can i ask you direct questions
on that were you in possession of a registration certificate and
ownership papers of the car at the time
can you remember the registration number of the car at the time
do you still have the registration certificate of the car
i still have the car but it is not going anymore it’s no longer
so you still have the car
so you haven’t lost the car
no i haven’t lost the car
all right then it’s a little clearer to me that’s not an
issue anymore you have the car
i have the car back but the car is not operating
we hear you did it not operate at all after you received it
back did it drive for a while when did it stop working
after i got it from the police station it was no longer working
how did you get it to your home
they took some of the parts vehicle parts and i had to get a
starter for me to be able to drive it home
may i refer to another part of your written statement you come
out with a plea and you say my please is to apologize to those whom i
did wrong what do you intend to say here who do you want to apologize
to do you want to do it publicly do you want to use this opportunity or
what are you saying with this statement
it’s because the majority of people in ogies found themselves
facing some kind of problem because of my being inactive in the group
there was chaos after that i’m apologizing because people lost respect
for me completely and the suddenly took me negatively as someone who was
collaborating with the police it there is anyone that i wronged as the
chairperson i would like to apologize now
do you have any specific wrongs in mind when you say that you
say if there is anyone so it’s an open plea it’s an open apology not
knowing what you’re apologizing for is that what you’re saying to us
it’s very difficult i’m trying to help you and lead you because i can
see your pain of having been rejected from the community but i don’t see
how we’re going to set the record straight i’ll leave it for the moment
i’m just telling you it’s very difficult to follow just a last question
you did say you’re not politically active did i hear you correctly you
said that your occupation was that of a teacher
where and at what school and what subject
umpukweni secondary school and i teach commercial subjects such
since when have you been teaching
at the time of the events you were already in teaching
again i’m sure i will just ask questions in a clear
picture how old were you at the time when you started being politically
active i will try within a twinkling of an eye to get the incidents you
encountered with the police and how you were tortured by the police as my
colleague said according to our statement there were things that were
not mentioned that you’ve just mentioned now
i started being politically active at tembega high school in
were you affiliated with a certain group politically
i always kept company with the students
the position that you’re talking about the chairperson was
it the first position that you had politically
when you were a student did you ever once have an 
yes i would say so because i was expelled from tembega high
school in and i was in standard nine then i was expelled around
the police would come and interrogate me there were students
that went to attack one of the lady teachers’ house who was working with
the school body master and my name was implicated even though i didn’t
take part because i come from the reef that qualified me that i should
have participated in some way and i was expelled due to that
at the time were you military trained
when you say you were an anc chairman you’ve explained to
us even though we don’t have this in the statement that you came across
this girl lying on the ground exactly how does that correspond with your
to see a young girl lying in the road at night made me feel so
bad that i had to enquire about that child because it could have been one
of the students from my school even though she was in the dark i tried
to see i wanted to see exactly who the child was and what had happened
when you came across the police were you once detained for even
yes i was detained in black park as i mentioned before
were you tortured or harassed in any way
yes they came to me every night to interrogate me and harass me
and after i had met my lawyer that subsided on friday saturday sunday
and on monday i was released these other three days i went through hell
they kept me in a cell with a twelve year old boy and when i asked this
boy how he got there he told me that he was selling in the location with
a certain indian guy and he was arrested but the indian guy was set free
besides that were you subjected to some sort of torture
thank you people can we just 
when you look back in retrospect you were suspected of
collaborating with the police what could have made that possible
i don’t understand you question but i don’t understand your
question when they kept me in the cell they fabricated a story that i
was generating a relationship with them and they made that to appear to
be so two of the people i told the comrades who came to visit me what
the police said but they would go back to the location and give their own
fabricated version of the whole thing
maybe as you have already said there is a lot of other
things that we don’t have in your statement like what you have said
that the police portrayed some kind of picture as well that they were
collaborating with you we don’t know whether they gave you some money
you may want to submit another statement because this one is missing a
lot of information which you have already told to us today
richard thank you very much for coming you raise a lot of
questions more questions from what you’ve said today and in your
statement i think the one important issue a very important issue
regardless of the difficulties of your statement which is how two
communities come to reconcile with each other relating to issues which
have taken place in that community i think that is what you are
struggling with today and probably have been struggling with for the
last few years i hope that by coming here today and having spoken
publicly about your difficulties and if there are people from your
community today who are listening they will take that back to your
community and something can be done to bring about reconciliation for you
and the community thank you for coming
could i ask if wilheminah ngakane is here 
maybe whilst we’re deciding people can just take a stand up
mrs ngakane welcome have you brought somebody with you the
person sitting next to you is it a family member could you introduce
how is she related to you 
it’s your daughter welcome to you too gloria mama ngakane i
know this is very very hard and very painful we’ve been listening to
witnesses that have been speaking about what happened in july and
about japhta and his role and his involvement this is an opportunity for
you as a family member to give your account and your understanding of
what happened doctor randera is going to assist you if at any time you
feel that you want to have a break please do so or if at any time you
feel that you can’t continue please do so try and be as relaxed as
possible i’m going to ask you now if you will please just raise your
right hand to take the oath do you swear that this testimony you will

thank you very much i will hand you over to doctor randera
wilheminah good afternoon and to your daughter

relationship to japhta and then if you will tell us something about him
japhta was my brother i came just after him i am the last
borne in his family japhta died a very tragic death i was at my home at
wach japhta came to me early in the morning and said to me i should go
and fetch my mother i went home to fetch my mother to take her to my
house and he told me that he was going or a bucket system meeting and he
said that i should attend to my mother because my mother was very sick
after a few minutes while waiting for him to take our mother to the
doctor i heard that my brother’s house was burnt down and my brother was
nowhere to be found i left for home to see this with my own eyes i was
later told that he was caught while trying to run away and i was told
that he is dead next to the railway lines when i left my home one
person said behind me you must bring him alive don’t kill him i know
the person’s name but i will never say it now the same afternoon i said
to my husband he should go to the police station to find out whether it
was my brother japhta who died and my husband and my brother’s son said
please get into bed so that we can tell you the whole story they told me
that he was unidentifiable you couldn’t even see his face we only
identified him by his feet and the nose that it was japhta
wilheminah do you want to continue we can stop is you like
i will continue that he will bury him the people
driving a mitsubishi went to germiston they met the anc people in
germiston and they said he was not going to be buried in germiston at
all he should be buried in balfour at that time the preparations were
already made to bury him in germiston we had to now come back to
balfour we were not given a chance to bury him properly we were six in
number the people who buried my brother my eldest brother was the only
one who put the soil back into the grave i a here on my own i’m all by
myself i’m left with nobody else i don’t know maybe my daughter would
gloria do you wish to say something will you switch on
there is this that i want to say we can’t really say
anything to them because when we conducted the funeral on that day they
were all around the township at every corner singing and toyitoyiing
the speaker’s mike is not on
my apologies at the end of the statement it talks about
japhta having other family members two children is that right 
the speaker’s mike is not on
he was married and he divorced
he was married but he divorced he didn’t have children with
the wife he divorced but there were two children a boy and a girl whom
your mother earlier on said that your uncle came to see her
that morning where she was living was she living in siyathemba she
yes i live in siyathemba but she was staying at wach my
uncle came to tell us that he was leaving for bloemfontein for church
how far is wach from siyathemba 
okay you live in siyathemba sorry how old are you i
don’t want to put these questions to you if how old are you now 
i am twenty seven years old
you said you were living in siyathemba at that time were you
living far from your uncle’s house
were you aware of this protest march that was going to take
i was still indoors because of a little baby that i got
just a month before but i heard rumours of this protest
i’m just interested to know if you can’t answer this i will
understand earlier on i think one of the other people said there were
many many police present on that day in siyathemba
i heard later that the police were present because one
member of my family was a policeman
what intervention was there on the part of the police on that
there was no intervention at all they didn’t help at all
if i can come back to your mother is she willing to answer
i am willing to answer questions
wilheminah it is now seven years since this i don’t think
you can describe it in any other way it was a horrific day for your
community for your family and for other families who are sitting here
today can you tell us how you feel what do you feel can happen to
bring the many families who have come today to talk about the deaths
that took place in their respective families your own family and perhaps
sir i don’t have forgiveness they should go and ask
forgiveness from him i am deeply disturbed today i am an orphan i’ve
got nowhere to run to we don’t have a family we don’t have a home
thank you wilheminah chairperson i have no further
wilheminah thank you very much for coming and to your daughter
these incidents these kind of incidents are always very very difficult
and it is really for the families at the end of the day who will have
to decide how they will deal with this how they will live with each
other the role of the truth commission is not there to dictate to
families it’s to create the opportunity for people to come and speak to
see what kind of reconciliation there can be to assist to facilitate
but that is ultimately a decision that you have to take with the other
families what responsibility we do have as a commission is to treat all
incidents of gross human rights violations the same i think that is the
thing which people often don’t properly understand that we cannot make
distinctions when it comes to gross human rights violations to the acts
people who lose their lives people who are tortured people who suffered
severe illtreatment people who would disappear as a result of the
political conflict that is where the truth commission really has to be
evenhanded and where we have to listen to all sides of the conflict to
all accounts and to treat all of those accounts in the exact same manner
we all have different political views that is inevitable we all have
different views on what the nature of the struggle was about but there
are many of us many in the commission who believe that the struggle
which people fought to end oppression to end apartheid was a correct
struggle but when it comes to the violations that were committed as a
result of that struggle there as a commission we have a duty to treat
everybody the same and we hope that this opportunity which you have had
to come and speak about what happened to your brother the way he lost
his life notwithstanding how we may feel about the politics of that
conflict but the opportunity that you have to come and speak about the
gross violations which your brother suffered helps in some way we
certainly hope that some means may be found for the families of all those
who were caught up in this horrific event that some means can be found
for them to speak to try and find some peace to try and find some
understanding thank you again and when we make recommendations with
regard to rehabilitation and to reparations that will be for all victims
notwithstanding which side of the political conflict they were on it
will be for all victims so thank you very much to you and your daughter
for coming to speak to us we will break for lunch and we will come back
at this stage i’d like as i mentioned earlier we do have with
us i’m not quite sure what one calls him now director director steve
ngwenya who has very kindly said that he will come and give us an
account he was a lawyer himself in ermelo practising he represented
the wesselton action committee at one stage he had bombs thrown into his
office two petrol bombs and he is now the director of land government
and housing for mpumulanga we’re very grateful that he has come we’re
very grateful that he will give us some of the background to the
questions that we have asked this will not be a sworn statement but it’s
more by way of explaining for us for the media what the background is to
these stories that we are hearing mr ngwenya could you come forward as
i say we won’t swear you in because this will not be a statement in the
normal sense but it will be explanatory if you would like we can give
you a briefer to sit by you but i don’t think that we but we’d like to
thank you very much for coming if you could press the red button 
i understand that at one of the meetings of the wesselton
action committee this concern was raised and these particular individuals
who are now committing crime under the name of structure which associated
with the action committee had to be approached to be repremanded that’s
when the struggle started these socalled indistinct wouldn’t
accept that i believe that night or the following morning they then
attacked all the leaders of the wesselton civic association they were
 agenda’s whilst we thought we were carrying the crime
the violence people had other agenda’s so the violence continued
people were attacked killed people’s houses were destroyed
	and at that time as you have indicated mr chairman i was acting on
behalf of the wesselton action committee and most of the people who
supported that committee well i can tell if an ifp member a black cat
member had committed a crime and there were eye witnesses and so on that
case will get nowhere it will either be the docket has disappeared or
the witnesses are not available or the charges will be withdrawn if it
ever reached court to an extent that at some stage i couldn’t even
believe what prosecutors were doing themselves that’s why unfortunately
the discussions i had with some of the prosecutors years later they were
so sorry for what they were doing because they trusted the police and
didn’t know that the police were fooling them
	well as i’ve indicated cases against ifp members were mostly withdrawn
or never reached court i also had to run around to try and defend most
of the socalled comrades who were arrested at that time i had a
secretary who was supposed to know my diary but i can tell you the police
knew my diary better than me and better than my secretary because if they
arrested a person in davel they will tell that person that you won’t see
ngwenya come to apply for bail for you because ngwenya shall be busy in
carolina or piet retief that day they fabricated so many cases against
the comrades i’ll say i was in court every day during that period in
three different courts every day finalizing cases i would say in all the
cases that i did there i think only one percent of those people were
convicted because all those cases were fabricated now the torture which
people suffered the sad stories that you hear here i’ve heard more than
this because at that stage my office was just an extension of the
wesselton action committee office or the anc office people were phoning
me from their homes you’ll hear old women crying saying ngwenya here
are the police beating my children what are you doing there people
would run away from their houses to come and sit in my office there we
kept on talking to the police but they didn’t know what was happening so
	ou know at some stage my own office was bombed as you indicated and a
guy who had been in detention at the police station came out of the
police cells then straight to my office to tell me who burnt my office
how it was organized by the police i took that guy one evening to go and
make an afidavit with an advocate in johannesburg the house where i took
him from that evening that very same night the house was bombed and the
lady that stayed with him died you know some of the things that i’ve
heard from the people it’s hearsay and i must say that unfortunately
some of the information i got was that relationship of attorney and
client so i will not be in a position to disclose names of people and
some of the incidents but i can mention that one of the stories that i
heard was that when these people were taken to nlundi they were found to
be weak they were asked to go back to wesselton to kill women to come
back with their private parts to be used as muti those people who were
in nlundi were trained there in nkuza and i believe some of them had to
be trained with those that went to caprivi strip and so on
	 had the opportunity of listening to the first few guys who defected
from the ifp who eventually went to the commission to make their
revelations some of the horrible stories they told there have never been
recollected up to now i don’t know i think i should stop there for now
mr ngwenya thank you very much perhaps we could just ask a
couple of questions by way of clarification tom 
mr ngwenya where a situation of this nature is obtained
more especially between the community and the police force would you say
that those who were in the police force in this are at the time are they
still here if so is there a way where together with those people
there can be a dialog over the past conflicts
i would say that most of the police who were here and who
were alleged to have perpetrated those times are still around but one
thing you know i don’t want to generalize it’s not all police who were
involved and without any brief from the current captain beukman i think
when he came here after the then station commander was transferred
things became much better we started to develop a relationship with him
we could go to his office i could see he was also a bit confused about
what was happening because you’ll understand these things better the
uniformed police and the security branch worked in different fashions in
yes my question was also going to be in relation to the
present what the situation now is what the community is and what can be
done to heal the wounds as it were
i will say the situation at this stage is quite normal you
will believe that people have forgotten the past reconciled but one
thing i can tell you i know of victims who still feel bitter and strong
about what happened to them their house being destroyed their family
members being killed i don’t know what one could do with those you know
it’s so difficult if you were there and you saw what happened to people
but you were lucky you survived sometimes you try and say to an old man
that happened can we forget and forgive these people he says maybe
it’s because it was not your child
mr ngwenya thank you very much for coming
ladies and gentlemen at this stage i have one or two
announcements to make the first one concerns statement taking lebo our
chief liaison person is here with statement takers if there are people
who feel they need to make a statement 
mr zondo can you hear me through the microphone it’s okay 
could you tell us who’s with you
mr zondo before asking doctor randera to lead you in your
evidence could i please ask tom manthata to swear you in
nsongelwa zondo can you stand up raise your right hand and
swear that the evidence you are going to lead is going to be the truth
and nothing else but the truth so help me god
thanks very much mr zondo i’ll ask doctor randera to lead
mr zondo welcome to you and to your mother we have heard so
much today already on what happened in your community of wesselton not
far from here we have a full statement from you i want you please to
first tell us something about yourself and then take us back to what you
can remember in and tell us what happened to you
it was on a saturday afternoon around about one o’clock and i
was coming from a tavern and there had been a mass funeral jweli it was
at about one pm as i was proceeding towards my house i saw a group of
people it was quiet at that time except for this group i had went home
to have something to eat as i was crossing the street i came across
three elderly men and they went past thereafter i heard some gunfire and
when i turned around i realized that i had been shot and they continued
shooting me i ran into a neighbour’s place where i hid myself in the
toilet when i got there i threw up and i realized that i was losing my
consciousness i went out of the toilet into the house and i went out of
that yard that’s where i lost consciousness i fell when i came to i
was being picked up by some youths who were putting me into a car and
ferrying me to the hospital when i got to the hospital i was sent to
kalafong hospital that’s where i was operated upon when i came back
from kalafong i was readmitted to the hospital i was transferred back
to kalafong where i underwent a second operation
how long did you stay in hospital 
i stayed there for two months
and when you came back during the time that you were in
hospital did you lay any charges against people you may have recognized
who were involved in that march 
yes i did open a case
michael let me just go back a little tell me how old are
were you working at the time 
i was working for the land surveyors
so did you lose your job because you were away for such a
long time in hospital or did you lose your job because you felt you
i wouldn’t have been able to go back because i had these
okay you have a family i presume with children 
no i don’t i do have children but i don’t have a wife
how many children do you have 
two michael i know we’ve heard a lot about amakati the
black cats today but let me hear from you your own understanding of what
was happening in that time today we’ve heard stories already from 
you’re taking us to this is almost two years later from the time
that things started happening let me hear your understanding i know you
said you were coming back from a tavern but were you yourself involved
either in the wesselton action committee where you involved with the anc
at the time or were you just an innocent bystander who got caught up as
people marched back from a funeral 
i was not involved in any form of organization either
political of civic organization i was just a working man i used to go
to work every monday and come back only on fridays i wasn’t involved in
any form of mobility or political mobilization
i’m happy with what you said but just tell us what your
impression was of the conflicts that were taking place in the community
at that time there was a gang called the black cats and there
was a lot of violence but where it emanated from i wouldn’t say
now this person who’s funeral it was jweli hey he was one
of the leaders of the black cats am i right in that understanding 
yes he was a leader of the black cats
he was killed according to your statement by some comrades
i wouldn’t comment on that because i have no knowledge thereof
okay sorry i may have read somebody else’s statement
michael you said in your statement that you haven’t been able to work
have you been able to apply for a disability grant 
is there a reason for that 
yes i do no but i don’t know the channels that i can use in
order to be able to speak to the social workers or whoever i have to
michael my last point looking back on that time now i mean
we’re now almost seven years if you were to meet with those people and
some of those people i presume are still in your community what would
you want to say to them 
i’d feel very bad even though i’m powerless i wouldn’t know
thank you michael chairperson i have no further question
michael did you ever come to understand what the comrades
i didn’t know anything because i used to go to work on mondays
and come back on fridays so i was not fully conversant with whatever was
as you were going in and out of the area you had never met
a group of youths that would later be identified as comrades 
i know that there were comrades that existed there i heard
that there were comrades and i also heard there was also a group called
the cats i never had an encounter with them until that day that i was
do you know what the comrades stood for 
i knew nothing between the comrades and the black cats
you had never heard about a conflict between the two 
yes i did hear that they were fighting but during those fights
yes one is not saying that you should have been at their
meetings or at their fights but one wants to say that as a member of the
community you could have heard people talking about these two groups and
mr zondo you do however say in your statement that you were a
member of the anc is that correct 
and that you joined the anc in after it was unbanned
do you think that those people who attacked you may have known
it’s because i didn’t know them maybe they knew me because
even now i can’t identify them i do not know them
michael sorry i want to come back to two issues one is you
said you had made a statement to the police was there ever any followup
 did you get anything substantial from the police as far as your
no they never came back to me the last time i saw them was
okay michael i just want to follow up from what mr manthata
was saying this issue of you were in the community you heard some
discussions about the black cats and comrades but you knew very little
about them now as we travel throughout the country and people come to
talk to the truth commission to us we often hear and particularly and
i don’t want to sound as if i’m categorizing people into black and white
particularly from members of the white community who say we never knew
how bad things were now can you understand that yourself because here
you are in a small community like wesselton and i can only see as i drive
past in and out of ermelo but it looks like a very small community
things are happening in your community people are dying people are
being shot at and often we hear that we didn’t really know what was
happening can you understand that the attitude that is coming through
from the white community they also did not understand what was
mr zondo thank you i would just like to ask one question
clarity from your statement and that’s to do with the actual funeral
which happened before this incident involving yourself do you know how
in your statement you said that there was this crowd coming
from mac guire street in wesselton and they were shouting a slogan can
could you tell us what it was
i have forgotten the song that they were singing
but they were singing a slogan
yes i do remember but i don’t have a clear recollection
because i was from the tavern so i was a bit intoxicated
as the other commissioners have said i think that again we
hear your story and we sympathize very much with it because you were
obviously caught very much in the crossfire so that you more than anyone
could be called an innocent bystander and as a result of that you have
been unable to work for several years now i think that there’s two
things that we need to say to you one is again to offer our support to
see what we can do in chasing up your case as you asked specifically to
find out about the disability grant and your possibility of getting that
i think we must also call on the community to assist you to support you
in bringing yourself back into usefulness so that you don’t feel too
depressed that you don’t feel too down it’s going to be difficult but
it certainly is possible and we would like to issue an appeal to the
community to assist you in that whether it’s through the church or
whether it’s through community support we would like to leave you with
the challenge really which is very difficult but a challenge that you
also make an effort to regain your strength and to carry on going and
going well thank you very much for coming
can i please call stafnurse mzwakali if the technicians are
listening wherever you are is it possible to switch off the
airconditioning in this place mrs mzwakali good afternoon can you
first of all introduce the people who are with you
i’m with my son and some of my neighbours
ma’am thank you just feel comfortable you don’t have to
mrs mzwakali you are taking us to witbank in you were
shot in the left hand we have you statement in front of us mr malan is
going to be helping you as you tell your story but before we do that can
you please stand to take the oath mr lewin will help you
ma if you could just stand please and swear that the evidence
you give the commission with be the truth the whole truth and nothing
but the truth so help me god
good afternoon mrs mzwakali thank you for coming to us i hope
you can hear us clearly it seems that the interpretation services is
coming through to you is that correct we have had your statement and
we’ve read it if you in your own words could give us your
interpretation of this again can you now hear the interpreters voice
it’s not clear she can’t hear anything
can you turn up the volume for her and see if that helps
we are experience difficulties with these gadgets this morning
something is clearly interfering can you hear us now and follow
thank you very much let me just again repeat what i’ve said
we’ve read your statement and we would appreciate it if you would take
your time and in you own words tell us what happened to you you are
speaking on your own behalf and the fact that you were shot will you
please tell us the circumstances and share the event with us
i was on my way from work just after i arrived at the bus
under the bridge on my way home i could see from the park around the
office that there were a lot of people and the police force white
policemen there were a few black policemen the white ones had guns
just before i could understand what was happening i hear the gunshots and
people were running away they found me on the second street where i had
fallen some boys took me and when i woke up i was at the surgery of
doctor mteto i’m not sure that it was doctor mteto when i woke up i was
at the surgery that is next to the supermarket but i’ve forgotten his
surname it’s doctor babe upon our arrival the doctor told me that he
won’t be able to treat me and i should be transferred to the hospital
	when we arrived at the hospital i was admitted and stayed there for
three months if i’m not mistaken upon discharge i was transferred to
kalafong hospital in pretoria where i was admitted for between four and
thank you very much mrs mzwakali a few followup questions
just to get the record straight in your statement you refer to the
surgery of doctor mokoni next to the kwantule shopping centre this
morning i heard you refer to a doctor mteto and a doctor babe i just
want clarity because if the names are going out into the open we’re
reflecting on professional people and i would ask you to be very
cautious go back think it over decide exactly who it was and let us
know rather than at this moment in time try to pick who really was
i’m not so sure that it’s doctor mokoni who was next to the
can you tell us a little about the nature of the injury to your
hand it was only your left hand that you were treated for were you shot
it’s only the left hand that got shot
what was the nature of the injury do you have any further
information for us before you start to respond i’ll tell you why i ask
that you say that you were in the kalafong hospital in pretoria for
three months sorry in general hospital and then another four months in
kalafong did i hear you correctly was that on a full time basis or was
that going in and out for treatment
i was admitted full time at the general hospital then i
was transferred to kalafong where i slept for those given months
thereafter i was undergoing treatment and training
and the nature can you describe the nature of the injury for
they shot my hand and the doctor said the hand is injured
and the bullets are still inside they’ve not been removed if it can
happen that that they can remove the bullets then they’ll have to
amputate my hand with those bullets remaining in my body
can you use your hand to any extent today
it’s lame i’m unable to do anything with that hand that is
why i am no longer employed
can’t you use it at all or can’t you pick up heavy stuff what
is the nature do you have no use is the hand totally paralysed
just back to the incident on that day you say you were coming
from work you saw the police and the people and you saw them running
away towards you and you were shot so you were just an innocent
bystander you weren’t involved at all you were not politically involved
i was not part of the group i was just coming from work
when i alighted from the bus i could see those people from a distance
most of those people were white policemen who had guns within no time
the gunshots started making a noise and then people started running away
do you have knowledge of any other people who were shot on that
i heard at the hospital that there were some people that
were shot there was quite a number of them
do you know what kind of ammunition were they using was this a
bullet that hit you or was it some other kind of ammunition
from my understanding it’s iron bullets
was it a single bullet or was it a pellet from a shotgun or
something you have no specific knowledge of that
i’m not so sure but they just told me that it was the right
can you just lastly tell me the circumstances on that day
i really don’t know what was happening but there was a
state of dissatisfaction around the townships the people were going to
you have no recollection what it was about do you have some
i’m not so sure but from what i could see there were just
those demonstrations but i cannot tell what was happening
sorry i have no further direct questions the chairperson will
take it over from here thank you very much
maybe if i can relate what the commissioner has just asked
after you were shot did you get any explanation what type of
explanation did you get from the community
the people told us that they were going to the park because
they were informed that there was a meeting a community meeting that i
another think i want to ask is concerning your hand you
explained that it is already paralysed can you explain to the commission
whether you are able to dress yourself by using your hand or are you
i’m can no longer dress myself i always have to ask
is there any medication that you are taking with regard to
i tried to get treatment from the medical doctors but they
told me there’s nothing much they an do for me because i’m paralysed and
the bullet is still inside but there’s nothing that can be done to take
it out during winter i always experience pains in that hand
the commission would like you to help them by showing them
the bullet is where he is showing you it’s still inside
as a person who was employed by the government did you
receive anything after you got injured
how long have you been working at the hospital how long
have you been working as a nurse
stafnurse is my name i was not employed as a staff nurse
at the hospital i’m just a domestic servant
thank you very much mrs mzwakali can you please just tell
us and i don’t want you to mention the name of the doctor why did this
doctor refuse to treat you sorry can i repeat the question i said at
i really don’t know why the doctor refused to treat me he
just said no my condition is serious and i should be transferred to the
hospital he refused to treat us
thank you is there anything else you wish to say
ma’am i thank you for coming here today in the last fifteen
months we’ve heard of so many stories where people have been shot as
they’re walking past a situation where there may be unrest walking to
the shops standing in their gardens sometimes very fatally sometimes
left with disabilities as you have been left with we’ve heard your
story we’ve taken note and we will come back to you thank you very much
i would like suggest that we break for lunch can you please
leave your little boxes and headphones behind as you go for lunch thank
you very much we come back at two thirty
 incident of detention and of assault and torture
do you swear that the testimony you’re about to give will be the truth
the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
can you tell us about the ‘ incidents please as it has
been said can you brief and to the point 
in i can start by saying that i grew up in balfour and i
left balfour in i went to johannesburg and i stayed with my
brother in whilst i was still growing up it’s only then that i
started realizing that our people were then fighting with the then system
or the then regime i did not have much experience in politics and i was
with my bother sipho nhlapo he used to tell me that he was a freedom
fighter and i realized that my brother was wanted for a certain bomb that
exploded in klapspruit when my brother arrived i think it was in the
morning or at dawn on a saturday he was brought by certain people that i
cannot explain i did not know them i was sleeping in the dining room
at that time i saw them bringing him in and he was hurt because you had
been involved in a bomb explosion and he had come to seek refuge where i
was he pointed it out to me that i must not tell anyone that he was
there we should not disclose his whereabouts to anyone i treated my
brother in the house until such time that he got back to normal day and
night i used to look after him and i used to look out for anyone who was
coming and whenever a car approached i didn’t wait for the car to get to
the gate i used to wake him up and that’s the life that we led i always
had to make him aware that there was a car coming he always told me that
he was going to skip the country and go to tanzania and that i should not
bother myself by giving them the details i should give them all the
details because they were going to assault me or possibly kill me he
gave me the permission to give them full details because he knew that
they wouldn’t be able to get him where he was at night i would see the
comrades coming to visit him and they would also thank me for the job
that i was doing on a thursday that my brother left the comrades
visited my place they were in a car and my brother told me that he was
leaving for tanzania at that time i didn’t know where tanzania was my
brother left for tanzania on a friday on the following monday the
police from john vorster square came to my place and they asked me
whether i had seen sipho nhlapo and i said i didn’t know sipho nhlapo i
said that i was a visitor from balfour as a result i knew nothing that
was going on in that house and i produced my id or my pass book and
showed them that i was born in balfour i was still looking for a job at
that time i did not have the special permit to look for work in
johannesburg whilst i was still at my brother’s place i was visited by
the police they switched the lights on they demanded my pass book and
they asked whether i knew sipho nhlapo and i told them that i knew him
and that he was my uncle’s son they asked me how long it had been since
i saw him and i told them that it was a long time since we’ve seen each
other they said i should wake up and we went into the dining room they
fetched my elder brother so that we could sit together in the dining
room whilst we were sitting there the police went out to fetch somebody
from the car when they brought this person in they asked him who opened
the door on the day that they had brought sipho he pointed me out as
being the one who opened the door they said to me that i had said i was
staying at balfour and i did not know anything at this stage i couldn’t
deny it because that man was pointing me out and identifying me as the
man who opened up for him on the day that they had brought sipho i had
to confess that sipho was my brother and he stayed at ndlamini they said
to me that because i had told a lie before i had to be taken in for
questioning i was taken together with sipho’s mother and the person who
was pointing me out we proceeded to john vorster square when we got
there they put us into cells they put us in isolation they came back
and begged me to tell them what information i had about sipho they
undressed me they found some burn scars on my body and when they looked
i think knowing that sipho nhlapo was injured by a bomb or in a bomb
explosion he sustained burn injuries they then thought i was him at
that time when they looked at my id book they saw that my name was also
sipho nhlapo so they thought i was sipho nhlapo my brother told me that
i should not steal any of his photos he had told me that i should also
be on the lookout for the long arm of the law i took certain photos and
hid them in the garden that’s where i hid them after sipho had left
before he left he told me that i must never ever try to hide his
whereabouts because the boers were going to assault me and condemn me
sipho can i interrupt can you tell us how they handled you
when i was in john vorster square we were put in our
respective cells the following morning they came and begged me to tell
them about sipho’s whereabouts and i had to disclose that he said that he
had gone to tanzania they left us on that particular day on the
following day we were put in different cells that’s where i was
assaulted they would put me upside down i don’t know how many floors up
and that’s when they would grab me by the neck and tell me that if i did
not disclose the truth they would let me go and i would fall onto the
ground on the floors or stairs below they asked me why i did not tell
them that my brother was there and he had been injured in a bomb
explosion i told them that i was very young and i couldn’t have known
that he was injured in a bomb they said to me that if they don’t get
sipho they would come and pick me up they also told me further that even
if they do get him they will call me to come and testify that sipho was
the one or to testify as to his identity
how long were you kept in john vorster 
they took us in the morning and we stayed there the whole day
the following day we were taken to be assaulted at about four pm the
following day we were only released after they had got hold of the
evidence that sipho had left for tanzania
was that the time that you were released and you came back
thereafter i remained for a few weeks then i came back to
so for the period you were held in john vorster the only
severe treatment was the hand outside the window pretending that you
will drop down and die had the family had an opportunity at that time
to instruct a lawyer about your detention 
it’s very difficult for me because i can’t speak about my
family i grew up suffering and i never had any source of support i
never had parents so i could not be helped i always told myself that i
had to see my way out i did not have a family as a support system i
how old were you at that time 
i think i was thirty something years old because i was born in
okay can i okay can we go onto another stage of your
in when i came back to balfour i discovered that balfour
had changed when i got here i realized that there were many things
there was some unsettlement in balfour because people or boers would come
into our yards and ask us for pass books as well as permits and i
objected to that one time when i was in my yard at home de bruyn came
and i went out of the gate when de bruyn came and stopped in front of my
yard together with the constable paulos ngomezulu they got out of their
van and asked me for my pass book i said this is surprising how can
you ask me for a pass book when i’m going out of the gate because my pass
book is inside the house de bruyn produced a gun i said there was no
need for him to produce a gun because i had my pass book in the house we
proceeded into the house to look for my pass book when we went into the
bedroom we discovered that my mother’s bedroom was locked because my
mother had gone to the office that’s when we had they wanted to
assault me because i couldn’t produce my pass book and the bedroom was
locked they produced guns but i was able to run away they hunted me in
vans and they got me next to the garage as i’m pointing i thought i was
going to sprint at that time they caught up with me and put me inside
the van and i was taken to the charge office that’s where i was
tortured they said to me i have come to display how clever i was because
i was coming from soweto they burnt and tortured me thereafter they
took me to the police station at the police station i was charged for
disturbing the government because i was not listening when they wanted my
pass book and i did not posses a pass book and i did not have a work
permit they said i was obstructing the ends of justice i was never
taken to the doctor thereafter i remained in the cells and i would
appear in court thereafter the matter would be remanded for a later date
and they would take me back to the cells that’s what was happening
throughout that’s where it started from i have been tortured
humiliated and harassed by the police until this new government came into
power i have always been present with all that happened in balfour
whether i’ve been present or not they would look for me and i would be
brought to answer for deeds that took place whilst i was away
sipho do i understand you to say you were detained for a
pass offence can you explain very clearly for how long and what kind of
torture was taken out on you for how long were you detained 
i stayed from in i stayed for one or i think it’s
we were still at ‘ here in balfour are we through with
in i remained in detention for seven months and i had
remained awaiting trial for two weeks in heidelberg when i went to
appear for the final time i was given seven months with no remission and
no parole because they said i had committed treason
sipho what had you actually done that could have been
according to them they said that i refused to produce my pass
book and i told them that i had not refused but i could not break into my
mother’s bedroom if she was not there and i had no right to enter into
her bedroom i told them to wait until such time that my mother had come
back so that i could produce my pass book
so you were detained for seven months for failure to produce
that is correct i was awaiting trial for two months and then
i was convicted for seven months effective
are we then coming to ‘ or ‘ the years now we are
which other year were you arrested and tortured 
in ‘ what had happened pass offence as well 
in there was a boycott i don’t know what had happened
because at that time in siyathemba when i arrived i had not yet met with
any political organizations so i was not clear as to what was happening
a shop was burnt or set alight and a certain mgune child was shot on the
day of the funeral we proceeded to the funeral and the boers who were led
by station commander de bruyn started shooting at random throwing
teargas canisters at us when each and every person has
got a right to be buried we went to try and speak to de bruyn as well as
his entourage of policemen and we requested them to give us permission
and offer us security if they were afraid that we were going to protest
thereafter they should put enough security they said i was talking shit
as i was trying to negotiate they swore at me insulted me and said i
should leave the place when the adjudant spoke he said he has seen me
and he’s going to get me later on they took that person and went to hide
him but i don’t know where we don’t even know today where he is the
situation was tense in the residential area houses were being burnt
down my brother’s house npostole was also burnt down mishack’s house
was burnt down when mishack’s house was burnt down i was disturbed and i
went to look i saw a caspir with adjudant de bruyn and we watched my
brother’s house burning down as i was standing there i saw the caspir
and the policeman in the caspir called for me and i saw a number of
police they said to me that i should get into the caspir i was scared
that they would assault me so i voluntarily went in when i got into the
caspir i got other comrades who were inside they said i should lie on
the ground flat and they kept on tramping on us whilst we were lying flat
on the ground i totally refused to lie and the ground so that they could
trample on me the caspir was driven to the office in balfour and when we
got into the office they closed the office and we were assaulted
luckily i was able to protect myself i said whoever is going to touch
me i’m going to tell the anc attorney or anc lawyer and they were
somehow scared by me statement they left me alone but they assaulted the
other comrades they took us into the vehicle and they brought us to
balfour when we got the balfour police station i discovered other
comrades from rotunda daduza who had been assaulted some of them could
not even move because they had been so badly injured as i was better off
than the others in terms of injury i tried to help the other comrades
who couldn’t do anything for themselves we tried to nurse them back to
health quite a number of us were packed into one cell and we couldn’t
sleep because we were packed like sardines i told the other comrades who
were better just like me that we should help the others who were injured
with the blankets and we could remain sitting because we didn’t need to
sleep whilst we were at the police station one evening we were accused
of being members of the anc and they said we should go and tell oliver
tambo to release us they threw a teargas canister into the very small
cell we tried to take the newspapers and extinguish or put the teargas
canister off we took the water from the toilet and tried to pour it over
the teargas canister all this time the police were laughing at us we
were brought food and the food was raw we were brought tea without sugar
and we protested and said we were not going to eat that kind of food the
other policeman that brought the food went to report that we do not want
to eat the food they said sipho said they were not going to eat that
food and this policeman came and asked me what i was saying i
reiterated my statement that we were not going to eat that food they
started kicking me and assaulting me for refusing to eat the prison food
they said i was talking too much the following day we were taken to
kroonstad that’s where we were hidden in kroonstad all this time we
were trying to mobilize ourselves we toitoi’d we sang protest songs
sipho please help us you seem to be talking about
collective treatment you are talking more about your bravery and
indistinct you are talking about could you please tell us of
the treatment that was given to you in detention in ‘ as you put it
just be very brief and get to that point
but i must explain please do not harass me as well because i
need to explain this because i’m relating this thing as it happened the
events as they unfolded up to the moment that i was in modder b now i
will not be able to jump all things and go to one matter and leave the
other matters out i need to explain how the events took place because
wherever i went i was tortured and harassed i was thrown from pillar to
post from one prison to the other because i wanted to fight for the
rights of the other prisoners i was the one who was older than them i
was put into a straightjacket it was the first time i saw a
straightjacket in the morning at about six am i was put into a
straightjacket they tied me there is a certain room which they call
kuluvutu which means the dungeon i stayed there and there were no
lights i could not move i could not do anything even when i was asleep
i could not turn and be in another position i had to remain in one
position throughout they realized that time was passing by they took me
from the dungeon and took me out of the straightjacket they took me to
modder b when i was at the section i was assaulted and taken by
a certain van taken to modder b when we got to modder b prison they
said i should looked after because i was a problem at that time i had
been tortured and it was the first time that i saw a straightjacket i
was very sick swollen and i urinated on myself
please if we can just respect the witness and just allow him to
tell what happened to him please
i remained in modder bee i was never even taken in for medial
attention at times when i was in the straightjacket it affected my left
arm because it was tied so tightly around me and my body was swollen i
was not even able to move or do anything thereafter i was never ever
subjected to any medical attention until i came to balfour to appear in
court i was given free bail together with jacob nhlapo we attended the
case at the regional court in heidelberg on the last day of the case the
court reached a conclusion and they said there is evidence that i was at
the comrade’s funeral but the policemen were not able to put the evidence
in such a way that the court was satisfied the court was satisfied as to
my presence at the funeral and that i should refrain from being at
were you ever a member of any political grouping sipho 
in ‘ there was no anc anc was revived in 
yes at the time i was a member of the udf
to which organizations did you belong 
i was supporting the anc even though it was a banned
organization i was supporting the anc even though it was banned
who was your leader at that time in those groupings where
were you were singing all those slogans 
i joined the anc youth league at siyathemba and my chairperson
please please people if you could just be silent just be
quite while the witness is speaking
sipho i have no further questions
sipho can i just ask a few questions please first of all
this is on the side has your brother come back from tanzania the one
what i’ve heard about him is that he is working within the anc
but he hasn’t yet come back into this country i’ve heard from family
members that is my relatives in johannesburg but i do not know in which
camp he is i know that he does visit his home but i haven’t ever seen
okay can i take it then to on that first of may when
you were also arrested just tell us what happened at the funeral of
abram nguni what was the behaviour of the police or was it the army
at that time what the organization did at that time disturbed
me because when i looked at what was happening around me when i was
growing up my eyes filled with tears this person was sleeping but he
had been shot and it was his right to be buried but the then government
called upon the police to come and refuse us permission to bury our
comrade even his parents or his parent’s rights were eroded because she
could not exercise the right to bury her son we don’t know where they
buried him and that’s what disturbs me even more because they smashed the
sipho you said earlier on that your brother’s house was also
burnt on that day but you were also arrested for burning houses on that
they said they were arresting me for having been present at
thank you i have no other questions
sipho thank you very much you’ve given us a very long
statement and very comprehensive you’ve also spoken for quite a while on
your experiences your torture you give the names of people who you say
were involved in your torture du preez and others de bruyn rather sorry
and du preez we have written to these people tried to trace them to let
them know that these accusations have been made against them which is
what we do whenever people are named as alleged perpetrators we give
them an opportunity to respond by sending letters to them as soon as we
have any new information on your case we will certainly be in touch with
you again thanks very much for coming and giving your statement
what i wanted to say is this i also want i remember that i
was working maybe i was also part of the people who tortured members of
the community because whenever a boycott was called by an organization i
was also part of the people who intimidated members of the community so
that they stayed away from work but that was the political situation that
prompted me to act in that fashion so i would like the community to
forgive me for my past or previous criminal acts i would like to confess
before this community i am happy that i never killed anyone i thank you
i’d like to call the next witness who is pinkie sibiya if she
could please step forward thank you good afternoon mrs sibiya can you
i’d like to thank you for coming and before asking tom manthata
to lead your evidence i ask doctor randera to swear you in
mrs sibiya good afternoon will you stand and raise your
right hand do you swear that the story that you’re about to tell is the
truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
thanks very much i ask tom manthata to lead your evidence
who is accompanying you mrs sibiya 
it’s my son i’m sorry it’s 
mrs sibiya are you working too 
and mr sibiya what does mr sibiya do 
but you have children who are attending school 
only one and the other one is at the crèche nisamsu
i see mrs sibiya you are to tell us about your husband
nbwenbwe who died can you please tell us that sad story
it was january the rd i will start by saying that my
husband was working night shift on that day he was supposed to enter at
about ten o’clock and he was supposed to knock off at six o’clock in the
morning it was the twenty third on friday early that morning he didn’t
come back home my mother came to our house and she inquired as to his
whereabouts i told her that he didn’t return from work at the time she
found me busy sweeping the floor she asked my to come inside she then
told me that a young man came to wake her up at about five o’clock in the
morning and said that the gunshots that we heard at night relates to the
incident where my husband was shot and killed she suggested that we have
to go to the scene of the incident when we arrived there we were met by
blood running all over on the ground
yes mrs sibiya we are with you in reliving your pain just
relax and take it slowly coolly
as i’ve said it before there was blood all over the ground
the were some marks drawn on the ground and we heard that the police came
to take some evidence and we were told that we mustn’t touch that because
it might tamper with the evidence there were three later we found
him at the mortuary in the township on that date there was great
confusion because one of the inkatha leaders were killed and people were
saying that if one inkatha member was killed other people should be
killed to prepare the burial for him the time came where we had to bury
him we didn’t live in peace at home at that moment especially amongst
the whole family the children and other members of the family i had to
leave and go to johannesburg to saro’s offices because he was a member of
this organization i explained to them about my problem they sent me
back to ermelo to the police to go and collect a statement the
investigating officer was mr nkonjani i tried to look for nkonjani and i
was referred to meyer and meyer gave me some papers and he told me that
the case is over so i can take the papers back to johannesburg to give
	i took the papers back to johannesburg and i gave them at the offices
and i asked them to give me copies of the papers because i didn’t know
exactly who killed my husband so i wanted to find out what i got from the
police that the case was over i came back with the papers trying to find
a way as to how am i going to live with it because i didn’t even have
money to engage some lawyers in this case even the children couldn’t
continue with their education like vusa beside me he had to drop out
from school he also realized that schooling wasn’t well for him because
there was no one to support him and pay his school fees if he needed
school shoes he couldn’t get them in time or get them at all i would say
that even now we are living within a thin thread and it’s so difficult to
survive we normally live by my brother who is also married i would say
this is a painful situation for the whole family after discovering that
the truth commission was coming to this area i went to give a statement
to mr nkosi it’s because i wanted some help i have a problem paying
rent which is high i try to pay at the moment i paid about half of my
rent and they told me that i must have paid the full balance before the
th inaudible families from that time that’s the last time i got
the help from these inaudible families and after the death of my
husband they couldn’t even help me at all
	i hope that maybe things to come to pass and we will discover the
killers of my husband because at the moment this caused the estrangement
between the families i would like to see the people convicted for his
murder just to find out their identities maybe they are people whom i
know just to make sure that my children are also safe because i don’t
mrs sibiya we are mindful of the state in which you are mrs
sibiya we wouldn’t like to provoke you further and bring about the same
sad memories of the loss of your husband but we would have loved to know
whether you are still in touch with saro or officials of saro in
i last met the saro leadership at the time i went to jo’burg
that was the last time i met them and i haven’t seen them up to now
because they told me that the person i used to meet with sandile got
involved in an accident and he passed away when i went back to their
offices they said they couldn’t find my files and they don’t know where
these papers that you are talking about the papers which
were given by meyer and nkonjani do you still have them on you 
the papers which were given to me i enclosed with my
statement to the commission did you know the incatha person that was
buried that day did you know the name of the person 
i would say that i don’t know his name but he was an old man
i wouldn’t know the surname he was mr twala he was supposed to be
buried on that particular date it was on saturday
how had twala died was he a victim of the violence of the
he was ill i think he died from his illness all i know is
that he was one of the top leaders of inkatha in ermelo
if he died from illness which means there was no
provocation from the comrades which resulted in his death i can’t
understand how the people in the community were victimized which let to
it was generally know that if one inkatha member passed away
on that particular day during the funeral there should be some killings
directed towards specifically the comrades because on that particular
day there were many inkatha people especially from kwa zulu natal and the
streets were so busy if they pass your street you have to run for cover
maybe he was caught running away unfortunately since he was working
within the community he got shot at one o’clock at night
as you put it nobody amongst the inkatha people was ever
arrested who could have appeared in court where you could be saying that
person was acquitted because nobody could be identified with the killing
sorry i might have asked a very lengthy question i’m coming to this
where you’re saying the commission should help you to find out the person
who killed your husband now it becomes clear that you are saying inkatha
members could have killed your husband on that day but because of that
kind of confusion no single incatha person was ever brought before the
court being accused with killing your husband are we correct to say that
which seems to even defeat the ends of the commission
because if we accept that there was that kind of mass killing to get a
single person out of it may not be easy i’m not saying we are not going
to do it we are not going to try to find that out i’m just trying to
point out how difficult the work that you demand of the truth and
reconciliation committee might be with that in mind we are saying the
commission will see what it can do how old is your son beside you
pinkie vusa i’m sorry how old is vusa 
he is twenty one years old
twenty one how many years is he out of school because of
two years in what grade was he at the time he couldn’t go
standard nine does vusa know what is it he could do if he
had to go back to school or does vusa just want employment and that’s
he also suggested that he would like to go and work but
well i have no further questions ma sibiya thanks
mrs sibiya you husband worked for spoornet
at the time that he died how many years had he been working for
spoornet do you have any idea 
i think it was about fourteen years
fourteen years did spoornet not pay you out anything from your
husband’s contribution to the pension fund or the provident fund did
you get any money from spoornet 
i’d say they did pay some money it was r and i used to
receive monthly allowances of r i used that money to pay rent for
the house and with that money i wasn’t able to buy the other necessities
do you still get that r a month from spoornet 
in your statement that you gave to us there is a certificate it
looks like a life insurance certificate old mutual a policy was this a
did old mutual pay you out on this policy 
after claiming the money from old mutual it was discovered
that my husband had a child outside of the marriage and i was told that
the mother of the child also had a claim on the same money therefore the
lawyer representing the other woman took of the money from old mutual
however it was said that my old mutual and the lawyer
went to old mutual and represented himself as the person who is
representing me and he managed to get the money out however we went to
talk to mr bia i would try to telephone old mutual in cape town and
they said they have sent the money to ermelo branch and i must go there
when i went there i was told that the cheque had been signed out by mr
van wyk and he is in possession of the cheque i went to van wyk and he
said there’s nothing to talk about he said the money should go to the
child out of the marriage that’s how it ended
sorry let’s just try and get this absolutely clear the money
from old mutual you did not receive any of that money it went to mr van
wyk who said that he was representing the mother of the child that your
did you ever try to get any legal advice as to whether what mr
van wyk did was legal was proper did you take up the matter with a
i tried to go to mr moody while we were busy with the case
he explained to me that the other woman was entitled to the money because
the child was my husband’s child i used to pay this mordien my lawyer
and every time i went there he demanded r and i gave it to him and
later i gave up and i just thought maybe it’s better if they take the
money because there’s nothing coming out of it because i couldn’t keep up
the payments with my lawyer he wanted money every day i went to see him
and the case was taking such a long time
presently what is going on with this case is anything still
everything is quiet at the moment i went to some lawyers who
asked me after getting the cheque when i arrived at their offices one
of the gentleman who was said to be chief of the court talked to them
saying that he couldn’t talk to me because if ever he was to talk to me i
should come there with my lawyer and he will talk with my lawyer
therefore i contacted mr bia he said i have to make a sworn affidavit in
connection with the lawyer who took this money unlawfully because old
mutual was saying the cheque was signed on my name mr bia called me on
this particular day today todate i was supposed to go and see him
unfortunately i had to come to the commission
what sum are we speaking about this money from old mutual how
much money is it to you were you told do you know 
after the death of my husband they gave us two thousand for
burial purposes they said there was r remaining as a balance
thank you mrs sibiya in your statement there is the record of
the inquest as well which really says what you say in your statement that
the cause of death of your husband was the result of wounds caused by
shooting to the head and that the person or persons are unknown that’s
what the inquest records thank you thank you very much and thanks for
sharing that other information with us
thank you doctor ally mrs sibiya thank you very much for
coming and sharing that story with us there’s no way of saying that you
sadness will be reduced by time i don’t believe that if every can it’s
obviously very great and very tense at the moment because it’s so recent
but all we can hope is that in some way this has contributed in a small
way to making the conflicts of the past easier by explaining what
happened for you still you have a young family to look after you must
find comfort where you can we offer our sympathy we will try to provide
the information that you ask for we do have the case numbers we have
the phone numbers of the people who for instance signed this declaration
which is august so we can follow up on that and with our sympathy
we wish you very well and again as i say thank you very much for coming
i would like to explain to you about the statements anyone
has submitted to the commission we sit as a commission and scrutinize
each and every statement and thereafter which ones to take and which ones
should be presented in public what is most important that you should
take note of is that even though you are not called on stage to give
your testimony it doesn’t mean that your statement is less important
than other statements all statements are equally important and we will
treat them equally and we’ll look at them as much as we’ve looked at the
ones of the people who have come forward to give their testimonies the
ones who have been found to have been violated will be compensated in
	there are some who may have realized that some groups are welcome to
submit their statements as well it is not as if we are looking at
individuals only we are looking at all structures and organizations as
well so as to compile our final report next year

there were police at the offices making announcements
through loudspeakers they were asking why our children aren’t going to
school we went to the park next to the police station and we were told
that the parents should go to one side and the children and students
should stand on the other side they instructed us the parents to sit
down we did that after that they said they need four old women and four
old men i didn’t know that they were staring at me and i was chosen as
one of the four women when we arrived there the white man said that our
children said we didn’t know anything about the struggle they were
trying to say to the police that we as parents did not know anything
about their involvement in the struggle i’d say there were four
policemen carrying big firearms some of them were lined up on the
highway the policemen came and they took all the students from the
offices and loaded them in a car and later they instructed us to go to
the stadium the children refused to go to the stadium but the police
insisted that we had to go to the stadium the children still refused and
the police didn’t actually tell us the reason for calling us to the park
they said they’re given us five minutes to disperse 	before the five
minutes were over they started shooting from there i didn’t know what
happened i just felt myself collapse and i was taken to the hospital
thank you very much mrs vilakazi we have a few questions that
we would like to put to you to get a better understanding and also on
some just a confirmation if i heard you correctly which is not in your
written statement you say that the people were called to lynville park
by loudspeaker did the police do that was it the officials who did
did they drive around the township with loudspeakers calling
and then secondly in your statement you say that they asked
you to move from there but you also say that under the instructions from
your children you refused to go to the lynville stadium
yes you say we were not given the reason and instead we were
told to go to the lynville stadium and then you say we refused under
instructions from our children i’m not sure that i understand that i
just want to hear do you have any idea what was interrupted
you didn’t hear me well i said the police said we should
go to the stadium and the students refused they said we are not moving
to the stadium i didn’t say we the parents but the students refused to
let me just also explain to you that the documents we have
before us is in english and we know that you made your statement in zulu
so the statement taker did a translation for us and he wrote it down in
english that’s why we are asking the questions to make sure we hear you
quite clearly that we know what you were saying that’s why we’re asking
the questions i’m not attacking what you’re saying i’m trying to get
clarity to be very sure about the situation we heard you also on the
shooting and the police dispersing the meeting do you have any idea why
they called you by loudspeaker why you arrive there and they then give
we don’t have enough information because we were not
was there no discussion when you arrived there
how long were you there before they ordered you to disperse
it was just a short while i think we spent some time there
because many people arrived and we were so many
can you tell us the nature of your injuries and the effect it
has on you today can you just describe that for us in your own words
the problems you are still having because of the shooting
i was so badly injured because bullets penetrated my body
from the back some through my leg and my hands some through my head
another one went down my chin and went out through my mouth i’m in a
painful situation because i had to see two doctors each and every month
and still today you have problems
yes i do and everything is very painful last week i had
to go to the doctor because i had a problem with my nose i can’t walk
properly when i try to walk i feel as if i’m going to fall sometimes
when i’m asleep i’m not able to wake up it’s difficult for me to wake up
so i have to stay in bed the whole day
in your statement you also refer to a case opened against the
police and that a mr makobe acted as an attorney you also say that you
attended the court on one occasion and you don’t know what happened
since since you’ve made your statement have you perhaps had any further
i went to the lawyers who called us those were the lawyers
working closely with the comrades the father and pastor from the roman
catholic church too us to the court together with the lawyers however we
were not called to testify in court we were told to stay outside so i
can’t say much about what happened however after the lawyers left us
they got another lawyer to help us and this second lawyer didn’t help
much because he just left the work these two lawyers were also working
did you get any compensation from the lawyers or from the
they didn’t do anything for us the police didn’t do
anything for us they only came to see us in the hospital and we asked
them why they shot at us but they couldn’t answer when we read the
newspapers it was written that we threw stones at the and i asked them
how could we throw stones at them whilst sitting down they couldn’t
do you have any papers at home from the lawyers perhaps which
we could look at and see if we can get more information from the lawyers
they didn’t give us papers they never gave us any
you wouldn’t have a case number or anything
i don’t have any case number because we didn’t even attend
mrs vilakazi we do try and do some investigation on each and
every case that comes to us we’re investigating each statement we’re
trying to establish the circumstances and we’re trying to establish the
veracity of all statements we will see what more information we can get
and we hope we do find ourselves in a position where we can get some
which will make your pain less than it is at the moment so you’ll have
little more understanding of the situation in the meantime i have no
further questions i can only say siabonga
thank you mr malan miss mkhize
mrs vilakazi i discovered that you got injured on the very
same day as stafnurse mzwakali stafnurse mzwakali told us about the
situation at that time and we want to find out why you happened to be
called by the police to come out because we have discovered that there
was some conflict between the community and the police
i’d say my house is near the stadium so when they were
announcing through the loudspeakers i heard them i could also hear the
students announcing that we should also come to the meeting
to set the records straight who was calling you was it the
the police were announcing through a loudspeaker they were
going around with a police van and there were three white men when we
arrived at the police station in lynville park the three white men were
armed with rifles and the other police were on top of the cars
my question was when you got out of the house responding to
the call did you trust the police
i didn’t know that we would be meeting the police together
with the children but when i arrived i found that there were so many
do you remember what happened was there any conflict
between the police and the students or did the students sing or anything
on that particular day there was nothing like that it
might have happened in other parts of the township but nothing like that
happened next to the police station in the park
if i could take you back to the shooting incident you say
the comrades selected you as one of the four women to stand up
yes that’s correct the children selected me as one of the
four women i think they were used to me because i’m a vendor i sell
things that is why they asked me to be one together with the other
when you stood up were you facing the police
yes that’s correct i stood before them but i didn’t say
when you think back do you think they suspected you as one
if they shot at me in particular i would think so but they
were shooting at everybody it was because the students told us not to
say anything to rather keep quiet because we don’t know anything they
were saying if the police wanted an answer they should go and release
those who were arrested and then they will get the answer they went to
collect the and when they arrived at the police station they instructed
us to go to the stadium the children refused that we the elderly women
should go to the stadium after the children refused us to go to the
stadium the police gave us five minutes to disperse about one minute
after telling us to disperse they shot us
can you explain more about your injuries we’d like to know
more about your condition after you were shot at but before that i would
like to find out who gave the five minute ultimatum
i would say it was the police i don’t see well at the
present moment but i even saw him at the hospital
did you recognize the person who shot at you
i’ll repeat the question the person who shot at you did
i saw him when they came to see me in hospital but i can’t
recognize or identify him now because i’ve got eyesight problems i only
know that there were three white men who shot at us
maybe you can further explain to us after you were admitted
to hospital you were physically affected can you tell us how you were
i was so badly injured i was a person who was a vendor
selling things but unfortunately now i cannot help myself to survive
because i used to live on selling things
can you specifically explain your handicaps saying i can’t
i can’t say exactly what happened but i know that after i
was injured i had a few problems if there is lightening my wound on my
head normally swells and my hand is damaged because i can’t do my own
washing my daughterinlay had to stop work to come and help me at home
this is so painful to me because she has children to support and she has
to come and work for me
you said many people got shot on that particular day can
you estimate how many people were shot
i will talk about the people who were in the same ward as
i it was the one who gave evidence before me mrs mkosi and emilina
sindani and another one from the mkosi family who has just passed away
were none of you politically involved
mrs vilakazi when you heard the message over the loudspeaker
and you went to the stadium how many people did you find there were
there lots of the parents or just a few of them
there were many parents and many children as well
mrs vilakazi is there anything else you would like to say
i don’t whether i will be making a mistake to say as a
disabled person at the moment i don’t have a very comfortable place to
stay i would like to ask the commission to just build me one room and a
mrs vilakazi thank you very much for that it’s been a long
day for you you’ve been sitting very patiently and also without
realizing it myself you’ve actually made us understand what happened on
that day because as we said somebody else came to speak about a shooting
and her injury earlier on you have clarified things for us we are very
glad that you came we’ve heard and noted your request to the commission
we do not of course have those powers to support requests as they come to
us but we will note it and miss mkhize is the chair of the reparations
committee and those recommendations will go forward to government thank
you very very much for coming today
thank you too i would also like to add that i need a
i think we would actually like to call mkijima mnguni to come
forward now if it’s possible because the incidents which sipho was just
relating now particularly with regard to abram is directly related to
the testimony of mrs mnguni if she could please mr mnguni we’re
changing the order we’re sorry for that we have changed the order of
the programme slightly to have mr mnguni to come forward we thought that
it is appropriate given that the last witness was speaking about the
funeral of abram mnguni who was the son of mr johannes mnguni and we
thought that it would be best to hear mr mnguni’s testimony now and we
will call anna motloung a bit later so please just bear with us good
mr mnguni you’re coming to speak about your son abram and the
events which led to his death and also the funeral doctor randera is
going to assist you with your testimony but before i hand you over to
doctor randera may i please ask you to raise your right hand to take the
oath just raise your right arm do you swear that the testimony you’re
about to give will be truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
thank you very much mr mnguni
mr mnguni good afternoon i’m not going to spend any more
time if you could just go ahead and tell us what happened on the first
of may the first of may is recognized as workers day just tell us
what happened on that day why there was a stayaway and then what
i was at home there was a girl standing with him outside i
just heard from the girl that he’s been shot it was the girl who alerted
me because i was inside the house they were throwing teargas canisters
so i was inside he house because i tried to avoid being outside the girl
approached me to alert me that my son had already been shot
did you then go out and see what happened 
yes i did it was true he was laying on the ground
can you tell us what happened after that mr mnguni 
the boys took him into the cupboard we could see that the
damage has been done and he was killed
what occurred did the other boys take him to the hospital 
yes they took him to the doctor he was already dead it was
just a formality to take him to the doctor because we were aware that he
you want to now tell us what happened on the day of the
funeral how many days later was the funeral 
it was on the thirteenth they never allowed us to carry on
with the funeral they harassed us and they kept throwing teargas
canisters on the day of the funeral it was terrible and it was chaotic
what happened after that mr mnguni 
they took the corpse with and buried him themselves i went to
them to find out where they had buried my son they told me he was buried
as i understand it they just took the body away without any
permission from you and buried the body
and up to this day you still don’t know where your son is
they told me that he was buried in greylingstad i went there
to try and locate the grave and there was one gentleman who knew me and
he pointed at the place where he was buried
how old was you son mr mnguni how old was abram when he
and he was still a student at that time
do you have any other children 
yes i do have other children
mr mnguni tell us what was actually happening in siyathemba
on that day you said earlier on that there was chaos and the police and
they had set the store alight and previously there was nothing
then they started that was when things started turmoil people were not
so as far as you know it was meant to be a peaceful day with
people protesting for recognition of worker’s day the first of may and
then events got out of control 
yes there was nothing it was quiet
what about abram himself was he a comrade was he part of
not to my knowledge he never mentioned whether he was a
what would you wish to the truth commission to do mr mnguni
i would like to have some compensation because i believe that
if he was alive he would be taking care of me and supporting me
thank you mr mnguni i have not further questions
mr mnguni where was the mother at that time 
you mean my wife she’s around
and the mother couldn’t even have challenged the police to
no she never made any attempt
as it is if i understand you well you talk of
compensation you are not talking about the chance that the remains be
taken from greylingstad to where you are right now 
most of the people do suggest that the body should be exhumed
from where it is and buried locally
who are these many mr mnguni who at the time of the death
of your child did not protest that he should be taken to greylingstad but
now you say they would protest for the remains to be brought back to
those are comrades i’m referring to who were present at the
in what class was your son at school at the time 
i think he was in standard seven that is form two
please people can people please just settle down and be quiet 
what did his teachers say when he died and when he had to be
buried and when the police took the corpse and buried it where they
they said nothing to that effect
they couldn’t even help you to get to the police station
where the whole issue of the postmortem or inquest could have been held 
mr mnguni just one last question did you lay a charge at
the police station against the killing of your son 
did anything come out of it 
they called me in when i went there i was told that i was
talking nonsense and they will never pay me anything the government
won’t compensate me in any form
and the matter of your son being buried did you take up that
matter as well mr mnguni the fact that the coffin was taking away from
how did you take up that matter what did you do 
i went to report the matter to the police at the police
station i asked how they can they do they laughed at me and mocked me
it’s very difficult to know what to day in a situation like
this it was hard enough for you to lose your son in the way in which you
did and then on top of that for you and your family to be subjected to
that treatment where your son’s coffin is taken away and your son is
buried at a place away from your home and from the community we have
heard your requests your request for compensation we’ve also heard what
you’ve said that members of the community have said that there should be
some form of justice and that your son should be reburied in siyathemba
also that the body should be exhumed from where it’s buried in
greylingstad and we will certainly look into those requests in the
recommendations that we make we will certainly take into account what
you have said once again thank you very much for coming to speak to us
and to share your painful experience with us thank you
i’d like please to call the next witness not mtsweri as on the
programme mtsweni if they could please come forward mrs mtsweni can
you hear me clearly through the earphones 
thank you thank you very much for coming who is that with
you if you could tell us
she is welcome thank you before i ask mr tom manthata to lead
your evidence could i ask doctor ally to swear you in please
good you please rise and raise your right hand mrs mtsweni do
you swear that the testimony that you are about to give will be the
truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
thanks very much we’d also like to thank you for waiting
you’ve come along way today to get here and we’d like to thank you very
much i ask mr manthata to lead your evidence thank you
you are accompanied too who is the person sitting with you
she’s your daughter what’s her name 
she has also come to testify with regard to what happened
tembi tembi mrs mtsweni can you proceed to tell us about
boetie mtetha mtsweni who was beaten up
maki or mateo is my son he was hacked to death by inkatha
members after they had done that i was not at home at home at the
time of the incident but my daughter the one who is present here with me
today was also present i was first from another place where i was told
that my son had been taken to the bethal hospital they fetched me on a
monday and i went straight to the bethal hospital when i got to bethal
hospital they told me that he had just been taken to kalafong hospital
and i proceeded home thereafter when i got there i was told of the
injuries that he had sustained we do not have any clarity as to who
attacked him but my daughter tembi said certain policemen came into the
house as well as an ambulance and they knocked at my place they woke
them up and instructed them to open the door but they were scared to open
up because at that time there was a lot of violence going on a certain
policeman identified himself as mandla nglabati and he said he had come
to tell them that my son had been injured they went out to speak to him
 that he was wearing and he had just arrived on that particular day
because he was from work he was working in pretoria on that monday i
was at home and on wednesday i went to kalafong hospital to see him i
didn’t know where kalafong was but i had to look for it until i got
there when i got to kalafong i was not able to identify him because he
was at the intensive care unit there were drips around him and the
nursing sister pointed him out to me and he could identify me by my
voice his eyes had been gouged out as well as his teeth all his teeth
he had no teeth left in his mouth
i stayed overnight at the kalafong hospital i was not able
to leave my son behind in that condition and i slept on the bench at
kalafong hospital so that i could see him the following day the
following morning i went to wash my face in the toilets the hospital
toilets and i went to see him once more i tried to speak to him one eye
gouged out and he could hear my voice he knew i was his mother and i was
told to go to pretoria i got to ogies and came back this way again
after a few days a certain policeman by the name of gramel came to me and
told me that i should go to court on a certain day i wanted to find out
from gramel as to who opened up a case or who submitted a statement with
regard to my son’s injuries but he could not answer me i asked who
injured my son he told me it was a certain man by the name of july
mtetwa and i asked him where july was he said july was out on bail on
five hundred rands bail i don’t have a clear recollection of the time
that he stayed at the hospital i think it was either one and a half
months or two months when he came back he submitted a statement himself
even though he submitted a statement the matter went no further after
about a year had lapsed it’s only then that the matter proceeded to
court and we came to ermelo i accompanied him to ermelo and the matter
proceeded we were addressed by the regional magistrate i think what he
said that i can really testify to having heard he asked my son as to how
he identified the attacker my son said i identified him because he had
hit me twice at the back of my head and he turned around and he held him
and the magistrate asked as to whether there was any form of light that
enabled him to identify his attacker he said there was some form of
light it was not totally dark and he could identify him as july
thereafter others came and they also attacked him that’s when he lost
consciousness and he could not identify the rest but he knew about july
when he came to he crawled to a certain woman’s house who was staying in
davela and the woman who held my son he called the neighbours and the
neighbours helped the magistrate proceeded to tell him that he was not
able to positively identify his attacker i don’t know who the magistrate
knew it i think she’ll proceed to say what happened thereafter
tembi if you’re going to testify could you please stand and
take the oath if you could stand and swear that the testimony you’ll
give will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so
help me god raise your right hand
tembi can you please tell us what you saw
it was in the evening when my brother got attacked he
crawled to another woman’s place that’s where he was helped
tembi just take it easy and drink some water
when they hacked him it was at night and he crawled to that
woman’s place there was a certain policeman by the name david mathlango
who went to report to the police station and the police came to pick him
but the person who identified him as my brother was mandla mandla came
to knock and report to us that my brother had been hacked when we opened
up he said do said tembi do not run away because i’ve come to tell you
that your brother has been injured i went to identify him when he was in
the ambulance and when i looked at him his whole left side had been blown
up thereafter police came and told us that july had been arrested i
asked them how they knew that july is the one that attacked my brother
but they could not furnish me with a satisfactory answer when he came
back his jaws were in wires and we asked what was happening they said
they were trying to fix his left eye he asked us to close him or try to
close his eye injuries when we got to the police station they pulled the
wires out and he had to be readmitted to the hospital
if i had to ask questions the first would be where is
boetie now are you still going on sorry
so july was taken to court for injuring boetie but after he
a year lapsed it’s only after a year that the matter was
dealt with in court and we attended the court case and the magistrate
asked us how my brother identified his attacker and the magistrate said
he was lying he was not able to identify his attacker that was the end
you say mathews was working in pretoria 
i’m not clear on that aspect
he was working with mr blosser who’s also in pretoria mr
blosser knows where my brother was working
you’ve got nothing from where he was working after his
he just started work during that month that he was hacked
had he not worked anywhere before 
yes he was working in middelburg
it’s very complicated maybe we’ll stop questioning any
mrs mtsweni in your statement you seem to suggest that mathews
and july mtetwa actually knew each other before this incident is that
no they were not friends but they knew each other because we
in you statement you also suggest that what caused them to
become enemies was some dispute around a tavern some tavern had been
opened and soon after that they became enemies can you just explain to
us what you mean by that
they were fighting because they were patrons of the tavern
but why were they fighting do you have any idea 
i do not know why they were fighting but they once attacked
him at some stage before they hacked him
who’s this they that you’re referring to who attacked him 
july together with his sister he was attacked for the first
time then then this incident was the second one
now in your statement you also speak about this conflict we’ve
been hearing about most of today the conflict between the anc and the
ifp you say there was a fight between ifp supporter s and anc
supporters this feud or dispute between your late son mathews and july
ntetwa how did this relate to this conflict this fight between the anc
and the ifp which you speak about was there a link 
july was a member of inkatha and he was a police informer
and all of us at my place were members of the anc
did your son after the first attack you say that he was
attacked by july and july’s sister did he do anything about this did
he report the matter or did he take any steps to protect himself what
no we never laid a charge
nothing your son was attacked according to your statement
that this took place in january of 
and you say your son died in january of 
that’s this year this january so there’s six years that have
passed in the certificate that you’ve also put in your statement the
cause of death here says natural causes what was it that caused the
i do not believe that it was a natural death he was always
undergoing treatment and i think there’s some substance that was coming
out of his mouth i think this was a direct result of the attack by the
in the attack you son lost his right eye that’s correct after
this attack he was blind in the one eye 
did he recover sufficiently from this attack did he ever work
no he never recovered thereafter he got sick and he was
undergoing treatment for the past six years for his eyes as well as for
ma’am mtsweni and tembi it’s very difficult to try and
encompass what you have actually been through because you have both seen
and suffered from the experiences of your son you have seen him through
the effects of the attack you’ve seen him in hospital you’ve been
through the court case where the person you think was responsible for the
attack on him is let free you’ve seen him being disabled and now more
recently you’ve seen him die again there’s very little that we can do to
lessen that what we can do is to try through the references that you
have give the case numbers to see what can be done about possibly
revisiting the case or reopening the case there is a report you talk
about as well of a disability grant that is there and in offering our
condolences and our sympathy i would just like to say that we will do
what we can to follow this through it must be very difficult for you to
have come today and we would like to say how grateful we are to you for
that we share in you pain and give you what comfort we can through
saying thank you very much for coming thank you
can i please call joseph buhali to the stage joseph good
i’m glad you we found you and thank you for coming joseph
you are taking us back to a year that has gone done in our history
already and will of course continue to be part of our history a very
important year because we saw the uprising in soweto in and of
thank you the aftermath of ‘ was felt throughout the
country and of course internationally as well you have come to talk to
us of what happened to you in july of and mr hugh lewin is going to
be helping you as you tell your story but before you do that can you
just raise your hand and take the oath mr malan will help you
mr buhali will you swear that the testimony that you will be
giving will be the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so
mr buhali will you be speaking in english or zulu
zulu can you hear clearly through the earphones
i would suggest that we tune into channel two for the
can you hear the translation now
swikele could try putting them on yourself
the witness is on channel three and he would rather have
he wants to speak in zulu how’s that is that clearer on two
did you say something okay is that clearer now okay are you
can we proceed thank you mr buhali as the chairman has said
you’ll be taking us back to and specifically july the month
after the events in soweto i’d just like to confirm that you yourself do
actually come from here from lynville
and you’ll be telling us about the most dreadful torture that
took place when you were actually nineteen as i understand it you were
nineteen at the time is that correct
okay could you please in your own time and your own words
on the twentieth of may we had black power here in
witbank i was working for the hospital and the kids came at about three
and told me that the violence had erupted in the location i knocked off
at half past four i was with david nbenegazi my friend we were walking
when we came across a group of youths throwing stones
	on friday the rd at half past four the police came to my work juza
sithole and another white policeman and juza approached me and said jc
my nickname is jc he would like to question me with regard to the black
power and they took with them when we went towards the white hospital
they used their telephone in the car and spoke about something when we
got the medical centre we got out the car now we have cosmos offices
there and i found a man waiting for me there and he said to me you are a
preacher’s son but you are full of nonsense and they handcuffed me he
made it so tight that i felt pain and he took me into a room and kept me
	at about six they took me out of that room and showed me three other
students george jeremy mabeni and makuskus nkosi they had injured them
with their handcuffs as well they told me that if i don’t want to tell
the truth they will torture me they took me back into one room where
there was a cid by the name of skusana and they tried to strangle me
they tortured me and also covered my face so that i don’t see anything
there were some chemicals that they inserted as well so that i’d
suffocate and they told me to sit down i told them i can’t sit down
because i can’t see anything they entwined my feet and made me carry
this heavy wood with my right hand that’s the fashion they tortured me
in they asked me if i was an anc member and they asked me if i knew
anything about the black power and i said no they opened my stomach
they cut open my stomach there was olivier and mashlango who is late he
was interpreting for me whilst the other white man was talking in
afrikaans they asked me if i knew anything about black power and i said
no they burnt me on my neck and on my testicles as well they said if i
don’t want to tell the truth and put the truth on the table i will
	i heard the door open and i wondered what they were up to them they
asked me if i was ready to say something and i said there is nothing
that i know they also burnt me on my testicles again and i urinated on
myself the other three that they showed me makuskus is my relative
she’s my cousin when she saw me she screamed and said why do you
torture him that way they kicked her as well and i was taken into a dark
	on saturday they took me to the district surgeon doctor joint who gave
me some pills to take on monday i was taken to the court of law and the
case was remanded and i was sent to paxton they fetched me on thursday
but they didn’t torture me then they even bought me a packet of
cigarettes they were adamant wanting me to tell them what i knew about
the black power and they wanted papa roy i knew papa roy and the other
three boys i’ve forgotten their names i heard papa roy and those boys
they thought i was an anc member or i was part of the black power they
	i was acquitted and they left me alone after that i was suspended for
not being at work i lost my job especially because my boss at work was
influenced in one way or the other i only have standard eight that’s
thank you mr buhali could i just ask some questions of
clarification in your statement you say that when they came to ask they
wanted to know whether you were a member of anc or udf ancudf
this was ‘ was udf around those days
to my knowledge no but they asked me if i was an anc or udf
i know it must be painful going back over it but if you could
just give us some details you say that your face was covered with
something what did they actually use to cover your face
it was a pantyhose black pantyhose a stretching fabric
and they put that over your head what were these chemicals
i think the cloth that they covered my face with had that
chemical in it because each time i tried to inhale i would suffocate i
even think it smelt like snuff
yes you also talked about them cutting open your stomach
as i was hanging there was this heavy wood on my right hand
and i just felt when they did not cut my stomach open but they pulled
my shirt so that my stomach was exposed to them
i see you say you were burnt did they burn you on your
i was burnt both on my stomach and testicles as well and
you mention in your statement about being kicked
at some stage you talk about being spun round what actually
happened there can you tell us
skosana put that sack around my face and started spinning me
around and assaulting me that’s how they were able to tighten this cloth
on my neck and i suffocated
you said that you knew skosana
i’ve seen skosana some time this year he’s still around
you mentioned also that your cousin came in and saw you how
he saw me as i was trying to get outside and skosana wiped my
face and i was bleeding profusely he opened the door and whilst they
were going out that’s when my cousin’s brother saw me right at that
in your statement you also mention at that point that there was
another you mention the name of another person who was with skosana and
mashlango can you remember that name
you mean the one who was with mashlango and skosana
do you know where he is
i don’t know his whereabouts now the last time i saw him was
so after all of this you said that they actually charged you
and then they acquitted you what were you charged with
they said that was public violence
were you just in detention then or were you just awaiting trial
can you remember how long that took
from july and i was freed in october the rd th or rd
i’m not too sure about the date but in october anyway
then at that stage you went back to the hospital to work did
i never worked because i was suspended
they suspended you immediately after you went back
can you tell us how have you existed in the last twenty years
what has happened to you since then
i’m disturbed emotionally because i think if i hadn’t lost my
job i would be far away now right now i earn a pension from the
you do get a government pension do you
yes i do a disability grant of some kind
how long have you had that
so what did you do between and what did you do in
you mean between or after i’d lost my job
after you’d lost your job up until the time you got your
disability pension how did you survive
i had to become a thief to survive until i was employed by lta
and i lost my job soon after that
and then finally you got your disability grant
could i just confirm all the disabilities that you’re talking
about that you have described to us they all come from the time that
mr buhali could i just ask one final question so that we’re
quite clear you talked about being you said you were hanging and in
your one hand you had this heavy weight and you said you were hanging
can you explain this what was actually happening there
i don’t know how to demonstrate and explain this this is
confusing they had handcuffed my hands and put my right inbetween my
knees and they had wood heavy wood right on top of my right hand
okay and that was then put onto two tables
that’s true yes and then i hung inbetween
and you were hanging there inbetween and you couldn’t get out
this was a torture that was used particularly in the ‘’s and
then again in the ‘’s can you explain to us just finally what it felt
like how did you feel when that was happening
i don’t understand do you mean after the torture or at the
during the torture what did you think was happening to you
i thought i was dying because that was my first encounter with
that kind of torture because each time they wired me i felt as though
there’s something that’s stinging me or the bees i was in a complete
state of i was surprised and amazed at what was being done to me
would you have in fact done anything that they would have
wanted you to do answered any question that they wanted you to answer
you mean i could answer please repeat your question
did you feel that you had to answer all their questions at that
if i knew anything i would have exposed it to them but
because i had no information or knowledge of anything i kept quiet
and so they continued to torture you
yes they continued and told me repeatedly that i was lying
mr buhali thank you very much mr chairman i have not further
mr buhali were they asking you any specific questions when
i remember the questions they asked me
what kind of questions did they put to you apart from whether
you were udf or was it not pac that you were thinking of ancpac
i don’t remember i think there was anc or udf and pac i
don’t quite remember they asked me if i was a member of udf or pac or
anc because they would through that question to me and each time i
screamed they will leave me and when i kept quiet they would continue
asking me again until i urinated on myself
you said in your statement and in your evidence that they were
applying this electric shock method till you started to scream and then
they asked you whether you were prepared to talk was it just a general
question or did they ask you about individuals did they ask you any
specific questions did they ask you about leadership what kind of
questions did they put to you can you recall any of them
they told me that one of the school children told them that i
took part in throwing stones as well
you say that you did not open a case because you feared that
so you did not report this to anyone at the time
you mean i never reported the matter to the attorneys or to
no to the authorities or attorneys who did you report to at
i only told the black power guys about it because they were my
friends and we were quite close as well as other friends in the township
whose names i won’t disclose they were the ones who paid my bail as for
attorneys pastors or reverends i never made mention of this to them
you did also say that the police took you to doctor joint
for treatment after they hurt you
this doctor joint is he still around still alive
doctor joint is working for the witbank district surgeon’s
so he’s still the district surgeon
thank you i have no further questions mr buhali
one question what confuses the commission is that the
statement takers are talking about udf and as you are rendering your
testimony you keep mentioning the black power and earlier on you said
they said black power has invaded the township could it be that you were
confused when you were giving your statement but now you have a clearer
we have to be clear about that because it would seem that
what you’re saying contradicts your statement you talked about three
children did you have those children after the incident or before
i have one illegitimate child but the other two are my
tell me about this one illegitimate child when did you
that happened after the incident in 
you said something that is not clear how did you survive
i wasn’t chronically sick i could touch and walk and i could
do a few other things in order to make my moves
when did you get chronically sick
i was stabbed on my head and i was paralysed on my left side
could you explain that incident to us is it because of
being a thief or were you struggling
no it has nothing to do with political things or any struggle
mr buhali is there anything else you want to say before i
yes if it is possible with my standard eight qualification
i would appreciate being employed i’d highly appreciate any kind of
mr buhali your torture that you’ve described so aptly is
reminiscent of so many other stories that we’ve heard i want to say that
this idea you put forward of black power in clearly from the
documents we have in front of us the black people’s convention saso and
other black conscientious groupings seemed to have quite a lot of
influence in this area and clearly you were influenced by that grouping
as well the reason why that question of the udf has come all the time is
because udf was not formed until the ‘’s and that’s why people have
kept asking about the udf thank you very very much for coming and
sharing your experiences today we have noted your request for
employment but as i said earlier the commission does not have that sort
of power but we will actually make a note of that when coming to a
reparations’ policy thank you very much
i’m going to ask if also a slight change to the programme if
we could have judith nhlapo to please come to the witness stand the
reason that we’re doing this is because the incident that judith nhlapo
is going to speak about is also related to the testimonies which we have
heard the testimony of mr mnguni also earlier the testimony of sipho
nhlapo so if judith nhlapo could please come forward mrs nhlapo
welcome tell me if you can hear me
mrs nhlapo thank you very much for coming it’s been a long
wait you are coming to speak about what happened to your husband who was
a town councillor in siyathemba and the events which took place at the
same time as the events which we have been hearing about from the earlier
witnesses mr tom manthata is going to assist you but before you begin
i’d like you please to just raise your right hand to take the oath do
you swear that the testimony that you’ll give will be the truth the
whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
thank you very much mrs nhlapo tom 
mrs nhlapo relax and be with at home mrs nhlapo is mr
when did he die mrs nhlapo 
do you have children mrs nhlapo 
what are they doing are they school children or are they
they are working i do have grandchildren
the speaker is not quite audible
sorry you are not audible you don’t get up close enough to
the interpreters mrs nhlapo can you help her to speak louder are you
no i’m not staying alone i have my grandchildren with me
but the older ones are working
you tell us in your statement that mr nhlapo was being
forced or pressurized to resign from the council what form of pressure
was being brought on mr nhlapo 
they insisted that he should resign and leave his position as
councillor after his resignation they bombed our house
yes he did resign after they bombed our house
after bombing the house what became of you and mr nhlapo 
what i mean is where did you acquire a new house now that
only two room were destroyed where they threw the bomb only
two rooms caught fire and were destroyed
can you tell us the whole story just relax mrs nhlapo and
tell us the whole horror of a bomb house the pressure for resignation
they first bombed our bedroom and my boy was sleeping in that
room i was still awake in the kitchen the boy woke up and furniture
so you remained in that house with some rooms destroyed and
this is where you are still 
yes i’m still occupying the same house the house was
refurbished and rebuilt the two other rooms are still destroyed and we
are still occupying the same house
the kids are the ones who took him he was in a kombi and he
it was not a car accident
what set the kombi on fire 
the kombi was not set alight or was not on fire as he was
driving he lost control and there were teachers there he was
transporting the teachers and they managed to get control of the vehicle
they took him out of the car and put him on the ground thereafter they
what was the postmortem what did the postmortem say the
he died as a result of a heart attack
it is a pity we are sorry for that during this time when
they were pressurizing mr nhlapo to resign what did your children say 
what advice did the children give to you as family members parents 
you mean when they forced him to resign the kids also
supported that and said he should go ahead and resign because the
i have not further questions i’ll hand over to the
mrs nhlapo in your statement you say that your son aron knows
quite a lot about this incident is that correct 
yes he knows better because he witnessed when they first
bombed the house the first bedroom because i was in the kitchen and my
i’m going to ask you if you would please ask your son if he
would consider making a statement and submitting the statement to us
this would add more to your statement
my son is not here i also did not know myself i only heard
today at about eleven i didn’t let him know because he doesn’t stay
with me he is in vereeniging
i understand that mrs nhlapo but he can always make a
statement it doesn’t have to be today the work of the commission will
go on for at least six more months so there is still time and if you can
contact him and ask him if there’s anything that he would want to add to
your statement anything that will shed more light on what happened on
that day in may also on what happened to your husband subsequently
because when mr manthata was asking you about the circumstances
surrounding the death of your husband you seemed to suggest that there
was more than just an ordinary death in your statement you also speak
about your husband having been involved in the taxi business and after
his death his taxis were stolen so there’s quite a lot of things in
your statement which if we could have more information would assist us
as i said there is no immediate hurry it doesn’t have to be done
today it can be done in the next couple of weeks if you could please
ask you son i just want to say to you also that in statements that
we have from others dealing with this period with what was actually
happening in siyathemba it is said that one of the incidents that
actually sparked off this attack on the houses of councillors and in
particular your house was after the body after the coffin of abram had
been taken by the police and the police refused to give the family
permission to bury abram in siyathemba but in greylingstad as we heard
from abram’s father apparently that so angered some of those present
that they decided to take their anger out on councillors and that a
decision was taken to go and attack the houses of those councillors who
had not yet resigned many houses were actually petrol bombed and your
family house was also petrol bombed so we are beginning to get some
picture some idea of what was actually happening in the community at
that time the tensions the conflicts the way in which the community
became divided and i think that without wanting to take away from the
suffering of anybody from whichever side of the conflict i think we are
increasingly beginning to see that this council system was at the root of
a lot of what turned people against each other that caused these
divisions those who were seen to support the council system and those
who were seen to be opposed to the council system one of the
achievements i suppose of the democracy that we have now is that we have
no such system a system which divides which imposes structures on
people we actually have a local government system a provincial
government and national government where people all have the right to
vote freely where political parties have the right to campaign freely
that was not the situation in the ’s the period that you were
speaking about without wanting to justify what people did people must
take responsibility but at least we are beginning to get some
understanding of why people acted with such anger such vehemence we can
see the consequences thank you very much for coming and speaking to us
from what i suppose we can consider the other side of the conflict
because councillors were seen rightly or wrongly on the other side of
the conflict thank you for coming and sharing with us and i again ask
you if you would please ask your son at some point to make a statement
to add to your statement so that we can have a fuller picture so thank
mr malinga would you like to put on the earphones please is
that comfortable can you hear the interpreters okay thanks very
much just feel relaxed and before asking doctor ally to lead you in
evidence this afternoon i’ll ask tom manthata please to swear you in
mr malinga could you stand up please raise up your right
hand please and swear that the evidence i’m going to give is going to be
the truth and nothing else but the truth so help me god
i’ll ask doctor ally please to lead you in your evidence thank
welcome to you mr malinga you are also coming to speak about
this conflict between people who were seen to be anc supporters and
people who were seen to be ifp supporters and what this conflict meant
for you personally and also for members of your family i want to ask you
now if you would just please take us through these events of that
you described to us in your statement
before i get started i have one request i would like to
move back to and start right there because that’s where everything
transpired to date during i was at home i was off from work i was
asleep outside i heard some footsteps i tried to listen well it was
one o’clock in the morning i heard someone talking to someone outside
saying you are playing and not really hitting thereafter i heard some
smashing of windows with stones and with one of the stones i found a
message which related to the incident which took place in this
message was written with a red pen they said in writing
		comrades there’s something terrible coming to you because 			someone
that’s what was written on the message book they suggested that it would
be better if we left the place and went to another place and if we don’t
move something is going to happen i took the letter and gave it to mr
maschinini and we discussed the letter thereafter together with my
brother busiso i came back home mr maschinini suggested that i should
take the letter to the police station when we arrived at mr mkonza’s
place my brother said i hate this letter i would like to just stick it
on the gate of mr mkonza’s house mkonza came out of his house with a gun
in his hand he wanted to fight my brother or shoot him i tried to talk
him down and we managed thereafter we left and went back home he
followed us home unfortunately my brother was outside inside on of the
shacks mr mkonza was with mr lucky mkwena and they were looking for my
brother they didn’t find him in the house they came into the house
looking for him holding a firearm thereafter they left the house and
went back to where they came from after that incident i took that letter
and went straight to the police station and i reported the matter to the
station commander mr oosthuizen i told him what happened on that
particular night the smashing of windows and that i realized one of the
people involved was mkonza and lucky mkwena thereafter they ran to
mkwena’s house i told him that i was coming to report the case and using
that letter as evidence the station commander replied by asking me a
question as to what can he do himself since these people have done this
to me i said to him you have to arrest this person as a person who has
committed a crime since they’ve destroyed my windows or smashed my
windows the station commander said to me i’m not going to arrest him
because he hasn’t done anything wrong or destroyed anything he said i
would like to find out who wrote this message first before i can arrest
this man you want me to arrest i asked him do you mean the smashing of
the windows wasn’t anything like a crime being committed he said no
that’s not crime i would say this happened on monday night at about one
o’clock in the morning and i went to the police station the following
day on tuesday i went back to my work and when i came back from work on
friday we woke up on saturday morning and went back to the police
station we wanted to take the letter with us to show it to mr ngweni
who was a person who used to help us mr oosthuizen said he’s not going
to give us the letter back because we’re going to lose it my mother
asked him since you say you’re not going to give us this letter what
are you going to do about this person who wrote the letter mr
oosthuizen said there’s nothing i’m going to do about this person
because there’s no crime committed here my mother asked him again what
do you mean what will happen if i come back from work only to find that
my children have been killed what are you going to do the station
commander said then i will come and take the matter because there will
be a crime committed there therefore we reported the matter however we
were never called to court to the hearing they just gave me a case
number which i kept a year lapsed and somewhere in mr mkonza and
his friends went to ulundi to go and collect some of his back cats
members he came back to our township with them and they said on that
night we are going to shit because we are not going to sleep they told
us that they went to collect some more black cats on a red van they
started attacking the children at school and the confusion started and
the violence spread all over the children had to be taken out of school
they were also in the company of policemen who were running in front
while all this was happening i was sitting at home and i saw three hippo
cars approaching my house and their was also a red car in front they
stopped in front of my gate and one of them by the name of stekum they
entered the house and ransacked the house they were saying that they
were looking for busiso i was not in the house but later after finding
out that busiso was there they didn’t say anything about it they just
continued to ransack the house they took our axe they took a axe spade
they also took a hammer and they took all this and loaded these
implements in their hippo knowing that they will come and attack us at
	i was sitting at home with malcolm sebe and we were preparing to go to a
night vigil of mr maschinini at about half past twelve we were about to
leave the house we had connected a pipe to the tap since they said that
we are not going to sleep we already connected a pipe so that when they
start burning our house we will be able to extinguish the fire it
continued like that we heard these footsteps and i heard them talking in
murmours then one of them asked is this the place in afrikaans and
another one said yes this is the place then he said if that’s the
case we are going in i heard them smashing the windows i could see
them pouring petrol all over the house and they set it on fire and i
managed to run to another window to see what’s happening outside and i
discovered that one of the policemen was kramer who was standing outside
holding a gun the other two holding some axes waiting for anyone to
come out to be attacked i ran out i opened the tap and started spraying
them with the water i tried to wake all the people who were asleep
while trying to extinguish the fire using the pipe i heard a shot fired
inside from outside i ran for cover or ran aside and i told the people
in the house that the people are starting to shoot now however they
started running to the other side to mr mkonza’s place and we continued
trying to extinguish the fire and before we could fully extinguish the
fire they came back again from the other street they were coming from
mr mkonza’s house and their number had increased now there were many i
couldn’t tell exactly what number there were while we were also busy
trying to extinguish the fire we were also guarding the houses to see
what’s happening while they were approaching i saw july mtetwa felwan
mtetwa his brother dingaan maluleke and also mandlu maluleke i would
say it was dingaan maluleke mandlu maluleke felwan mtetwa july mtetwa
and mike metabula i heard them saying are you still standing outside 
get inside you bastards and as we were running into our house we could
hear the gunshots they were firing while i tried to peep through the
window in the kitchen i could see them coming right into the house and i
saw dingaan maluleke pointing his rifle to the window therefore i went
under cover and ran into the bedrooms they went inside by knocking the
door the were shouting the inkatha slogan and saying di di as we are
saying at the moment they were destroying everything the furniture the
gunshots continued the inaudible of shots and there was no way we
could defend ourselves because they were fully armed
	as i’ve already said in the morning the police came to take anything
that we could arm ourselves with during the day so we had nothing to
defend ourselves we had to run for cover i ran to the toilet to hide
they took the cans which were on at that time and tried to lead their way
through they passed the toilet where i was hiding and they entered into
my mother’s bedroom they continued shooting using the guns the pangas
and destroying everything i realized that in order to see what they’re
doing i have to hide because if i come out they will kill all of us and
there will be no one who will be able to give evidence as to what
happened as i’m sitting here today i managed to do it because i had to
hide in order to get a picture of everything that was happening however
it was so painful because when i heard my mother screaming and crying
saying mika why are killing me they responded by saying keep quiet are
you still making a noise you bastard they were insulting my mother i
felt i should come out and do something but i ended up saying and you
dogs what are you doing i heard someone saying there is someone
inside the room and the other one said no there is no one we have
finished all of them they were talking and saying they are already dead
they’re just saying their last words let’s go i listened to that and
someone insisted that there was someone somewhere inside the room and i
crept down i managed to creep under a mattress and i could see them
through the hole of the toilet’s door they were coming towards my
position july mtetwa and those people mika they came and they started
looking for me in the house they were arguing amongst themselves and one
was saying no no no you didn’t hear well all the people are dead
let’s go i thought that means that all the people have been killed in
the family it means i’m the only one that survived while listening to
that one of them suggested that they should leave the place the other
one said i have lost my axe and the other one said no you don’t have
to pick up the axe because we don’t have the time lets go i heard the
sound of a caspir coming to stop outside and one white man asked in
afrikaans are you finished the other one said in afrikaans we have
killed all the dogs i could see that things were bad outside the police
were there too they got out and got into the hippo or the caspir while
they were getting into the hippo i went out of the toilet and moved
towards my sister’s room and i peeped through the bedroom window to se
what was happening outside i could see it was a casspir which was
loading these people i saw mandla and his brothers getting into the
casspir together with some other people whose names i did not know
	i would say there was one gentleman whose name was israel tlangwane he
was in their company he was a strong headed person he was an instigator
of violence in the community and he was staying at mkonza’s place
however when i went to give a statement i didn’t know his name but i saw
him as an instigator they used to refer to him by another name which was
a nickname just to confuse the people after leaving our place they drove
for approximately twenty five metres and the caspir stopped another one
was moving in the opposite direction and they started talking to the
other people in the other caspir the other one continued in it’s
direction while the others were coming towards our place when they
arrived at home they alighted as they were arriving i also realized that
they also burnt the other houses nearby since they shot my mother and
she was crying i tried to help her by taking her out of the house because
she was going to burn with the house i tried to take my mother out i
also tried to pull her burnt mattress and i also helped another lady who
was my brother’s girlfriend by pulling her out and took them out of the
house when the casspir arrived the police asked what’s happening here
i told them straight that you the police know exactly all that has
happened this casspir which you just met going in the opposite
direction those are the people who came to attack us since this was the
truth they didn’t take this seriously
	they started asking the other people what they have seen the people
confirmed that they saw the police attacking us the person in charge of
the police van wyk said yes you know but this is a issue between
inkatha and the anc i wondered where he got that information so i
thought maybe he knows a lot about this violence he said to me we must
help them find some cartridges or any other evidence and keep and he will
come tomorrow to collect those cartridges as evidence we found
cartridges but we didn’t give them to him he said we have to leave the
place and go to the office where we will be accommodated he said we have
to move because these people will come back and kill us i said to him
no we can’t leave this house and go and stay at the office because you’re
going to come back and burn this house so we’re not going with you he
said to me it’s not going to help staying here we are going to look
after the house go to the office and stay there i asked him how long
was he going to stay in the house he said we’ll wait until you come
back and we will leave as soon as you come back finally we decided to
go i wasn’t willing myself but i had to go because my sister insisted
that we go because the people will come back and kill us i was saying to
myself no the people who are going to kill us are the very same people
who want to guard the house
	we left and we went to the office and stayed there in the morning when
we got back home we found that the house was burning and the police who
promised to guard the house were not there and everything was already
burnt down i just told them that i told them before that i knew this was
going to happen i knew that now that they burnt the house and went back
to the police station they will probably come back and ask many questions
about it as we were sitting there they came back and asked did you find
any cartridges they said we must look around and maybe we will find
some cartridges and then we must take them to them i told them that we
searched for them but we didn’t find anything i knew we did get the
cartridges and we gave them to mr machinini
	on the day of the funeral mr machinini gave to gill marcus gill marcus
took those cartridges and took them to johannesburg it continued for a
few days some reporters from weekly mail which were white came to take
statements we gave them statements and when they finished they left
they said they were going to mr mkonza’s place i would say before the
funeral i realized that i don’t have enough money for the funeral so i
decided to go to my workplace
	however before going to my work i decided to go to the police to tell
them that they must call my workplace and tell them that i’m not going to
be able to go to work because of the incident that took place at my
house oosthuizen called and i asked him to please try to contact the
people at my work and tell them that i can’t come to work because you
people came to my house you burnt it down and you also shot my mother
tell them that i’ll come as soon as i’m ready to come to work mr
oosthuizen took the phone numbers i think he did contact them but i
don’t know what happened when i went back to my workplace i explained
what had happened to our family they said they had heard about the
problem i told the people at my workplace that i don’t have enough money
for the funeral and i asked them to lend me about seven hundred rand
they promised to give me the seven hundred rand loan and they gave me the
loan i then left for home it was on the weekend of the funeral
	after the funeral the black cats from mkonza’s place called the police
to come and provide some security for them because they thought the
comrades were going to attack them the police came to give them the
necessary security when coming back from the funeral or from the
graveyard the comrades were asking where do these black cats stay we
had to show them mkonza’s place and when we were passing by they found
that the police were still guarding mkonza’s house and when the comrades
tried to alight moving towards their direction the police drew their
guns and pointed them at the comrades when the police discovered that we
were in the company of gill marcus they were afraid therefore they got
into their casspirs and drove away
	we went to johannesburg to give statements at shell house we gave the
statements and came back home i asked gill marcus to call my workplace
to explain to them that since i’m still busy with the funeral
arrangements and giving statements i won’t be able to go to work gill
marcus called the workplace and she told me that she called my seniors at
work but they did not seem to understand my request she suggested that
if they give me any problems i should come back to her then came the
date where i had to go back to work i would say that before going back
to work my shoes were still wet from trying to extinguish the fire and it
happened that some glass cut me under my feet i had to go to a doctor to
check my feet he checked me and referred me to a hospital in hospital
they took me to xray and they checked me thereafter i was released and
	the day came where i had to go to work and i went back to work at work
i met a foreman they already closed my card key so i couldn’t have
access i couldn’t get into the company’s premises i asked them why is
it impossible for me to get inside because you’ve stopped my card key
the foreman told me that he didn’t know why but if i want to know more as
to what happened to my card key i should come back tomorrow morning the
next morning i went back to my workplace i tried to open with my card
key but the security gate didn’t open i asked them again why can’t i
use my card key to gain access into these premises 
one security guard by the name of twalaseni called and asked why my card
key was stopped because they should understand what happened to me i had
some terrible incidents i mean accidents at home the foreman said we
can’t take back this man because he is a communist we don’t want a
communist inside sasol i asked them why they have to refer to me as a
communist they didn’t give me any explanation so i just waited outside
however i could see that i wasn’t going anywhere with this so i left
	i took a taxi back to johannesburg and i went straight to gill marcus
and explained to her what happened she referred me to comrade sydney
sydney took a statement from me and then he suggested that i should go
home and he will contact me to tell me about the developments from there
i didn’t hear anything of any progress i went back after some time to
ask what was happening about my work issue comrade sydney said tried to
discuss your issue but we didn’t come to a final conclusion just go and
wait for some time maybe we will see if anything develops he suggested
that i should also try to contact some members in my branch in secunda
and maybe they might help me with the issue i went to the union’s
office’s in secunda because i was under the chemical workers union there
i met comrade david maswangani he was an organizer for the union he
tried to contact the people inside the firm but they didn’t want to take
the case they said going to sit down and discuss my case because the
people phuma was supposed to sit down with to talk about my problem with
the foremen had already resigned from work
mr malinga we are going to come back to the question of your
present situation later i just want us to go back to the incidents that
you’ve already described in your statement this was something very
horrific to lose your family members your mother nsacharia malinga who
was actually hacked to death you say that you did open a court case at
davel police station and you were actually issued with case numbers but
that nothing has developed from this we have on the basis of what you
have submitted to us tried to take the matter further to get dockets
and to see what role the police actually played in this so from the side
of the commission we will try and follow up on all of the leads in your
statement we have also sent letters to the people whom you mention as
the perpetrators whom you spoke about in your statement as well
napoleon mkonza matebule maluleka schlangwani mtetwa all of those
people have actually been sent letters for them to comment on these
allegations which you make that they were directly involved i really
want to just try and see if we can understand what was going on here and
this is not to take away at all from your personal suffering which must
be very difficult it seems that what we do know is that this mr mkonza
you refer to napoleon mkonza that at that point in time he was actually
the mayor in the township not so
according to him and this is just his version and account he
says that his feud with you and your family began when the anc tried to
burn his house and the anc also tried to burn the house of his wife’s
father who was also a councillor mr mkonza was a councillor and members
of his family were also councillors and he says that he saw the
attackers those who tried to attack and burn down his house he saw the
attackers run into that corner house where one of the boys is a comrade
indicating that was your house he says this for him was the source of
the conflict his sister he says who was married to july mtetwa whom
you also mention as one of the alleged perpetrators and we heard july
mtetwa’s name earlier also he says the sister of mkonza napoleon mkonza
was married to july mtetwa and that her house was also set on fire
that’s his account to the background of this conflict do you want to
i don’t know about the burning of his house i wasn’t even
there but what i do know is that he will have to say who were the
attackers of his inlaw’s house but i do not recall any incident like
that as to who attacked his house and ran into my house afterwards
before this conflict were you and mr mkonza friends did you
speak to each other before all of this happened before the stone was
thrown through your window and before 
that’s correct we were quite used to each other
you lived very close to each other in fact two houses away from
it’s only one house not two houses
so you were friends before all of this happened 
yes we were used to each other but i grew up in front of him
from your side what was it then that changed this relationship
where you knew each other where you would greet each other where you
would talk to each other what happened to change that 
the cause was that i refused to support his organization of
black cats he wanted me to join the black cats group and i refused
completely and that was the beginning of the whole thing that was where
and his claim that the reason the councillors like himself and
other members of his family became part of the black cats and later
inkatha he says was that inkatha protected the councillors against the
anc against the comrades who will attack them that’s his claim
no they were not attacked they were never attacked at once
it’s only because they mkonza wanted us to be his follower each time
we tried to convene a meeting at umvolo somewhere and we asked for the
key he would refuse to give us the key because he was not a supporter of
where any houses of any councillors or any people who were
thought to be members of inkatha or part of the black cats were any of
those houses ever attacked burnt that you know of i’m not asking if
you did it i’m asking if any houses were attacked 
their houses some were attacked and some were set alight on
that very day that they were attacked i think that they were also
confused they were not sure as to which house they were attacking they
ended up attacking their own houses as well
now we know that there were also many attempts made throughout
this period the ’s to try and bring about peace in your area in
kwadela and that the national peace accord also got involved in your
opinion were these efforts successful the involvement of the national
peace accord in kwadela to try and bring the different groups together
to try and bring about peace 
yes that was successful but mkonza was against all that
because he will start again suddenly when it stable and send his black
cat members throughout the location and instruct them to the surface
in august i think you actually referred to this the weekly
mail sent reporters to your area and they actually had interviews with
both you and napoleon mkonza do you remember those reporters you
actually referred to it when you were speaking earlier and the reporter
says that this warring that was taking place in the township he says
that this will only come to an end when people like napoleon mkonza and
philemon masinga malinga sorry philemon malinga start talking to each
other again has that happened do you and mr mkonza talk to each other
after all these years how do you see peace coming in the township
especially between you and those who you believe were the perpetrators of
this deed against you and your family how do you believe that peace can
come that this conflict can finally be resolved 
if they may attempt to pay back the way i want them to pay i
think there will be peace thereafter
thank you very much mr malinga
thank you doctor ally tom do you have any more questions mr
malinga i’d like to thank you very much for coming a lot of what could
be said in summing up doctor ally has already said we have noted the
one extra thing that hasn’t yet been mentioned that i have noted is
your request for a tombstone to be raised for your mother we will
certainly check through with the case numbers and see what we can do to
	it’s fitting perhaps that we should the testimony today from the people
of ermelo with this extensive account of a dispute which still seems to
be going on and which has caused so much grief and so much pain and
suffering and so many deaths in the community we’d like to say thank you
very much for your part in bringing this information to us thank you
ladies and gentlemen although it’s not part of your
programme we had planned it as such today but we were waiting on mr
mark shinners who’s with us now in there was a very big trial in
bethal of eighteen people who were members or thought to be members of
the pac pan african congress south africa mr mark shinners was one of
the people mr shinners good afternoon thank you very much
for coming mr shinners you heard my introductory remarks already so i’m
not going to waste any more time
	as the panelists may well ask you questions at the end of your
statement i feel that you need to take the oath nonetheless could you
just stand and repeat after me i swear that the story i’m about to tell
is the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
thank you very much the floor is yours
today we look back at the history of our struggle we look
back at the cost and the immense suffering that our struggle entailed we
look at the present successors but also we look back at the human cost
the ordinary people who made our struggle develop the bethal trial was a
reflection in most measures of the struggle of our people it came about
because the african people refused to accept that they had to live with
oppression with injustices with racial discrimination and to be
discriminated upon and live with all the things which were intended to
	i’ve referred to the question that in a sense the trial was prismatic
it was something that took place in an isolated place and yet it
reflected so much there was a totality of things that were reflected
generally may i at this stage also say that while i may be giving the
general view of the bethal trial i’ve had the chance to consult with
some of my coaccused those that are still alive and they have shown an
interest to give an account of their particular experiences particularly
they type of torture they had to endure it’s difficult for somebody to
give an account of the experiences of someone else and also in the case
of families like the motopeng family had to endure a lot the sebukwe’s
too there is a perception that only sir robert sebukwe was affected
people forgot that mrs robeiro was his sister and doctor ferdinand
robeiro was his brotherinlaw so it places a lot of stress on that
family because the perception is simply that it seems these are
occurrences that are quite unrelated and quite different
	for this reason i feel that it would be advisable i don’t know whether
this is the correct word to use that the commission give those that are
in a position to come forward a chance to give an account as to why it
happened you ended up being an accused in the bethal trial simply
because you refused to break down you refused to succumb to the immense
torture in form of isolation interrogation the pain that was inflicted
and in some cases even death
	i’ve tried to list some of our comrades who died during the situation
leading up to the trial some of them were staying in the same sections
people like sam malinga was taken in for interrogation he
looked very looked very blithe in a situation where many people couldn’t
even afford to smile but he was one of the rare people whose smile i can
remember to this day hardly a week later we heard that sam malinga has
	aron xhosa it was said he also committed suicide in detention but you
know it’s a funny thing because aron’s cell was in the old jail in
pietermaritzburg the floor was a wooden floor so one could easily hear
footsteps you were able to distinguish whether it was a warder coming or
somebody else coming because of your isolation he hear nothing the
little sounds you hear maybe that animal like indistinct
	then on that certain night there was this heavy shuffling and somebody
was either carrying a bag or something heavy up the stairs past the
passage and in the morning we heard a shout through the window the term
that we used because of the situation was a codename for freedom
fighters we used to refer to freedom fighters as horses amahashe if
ever there was reference to a horse a racing horse then we knew that it
was a freedom fighter somebody shouted through a window and said i
think it was moses masemala he said that a horse is dead in the cell
apparently he was told by one of the cleaners
	may i mention that a few days later in the reception office of the
prison there was a heated confrontation between warders and security
police these warders were saying that to take any prisoner out of this
place you have to ensure that you comply with the requirements of the
prison service you cannot just take prisoners out of the prison complex
and away without any record being kept this was just a few days after
the death of aron xhosa one can go on
	we have the case of wyembibi mnzizi whose photograph has a very chilling
reflection hanging in the toilet his feet below the bowl between the
cistern with a rope around his neck his toes touching the floor and yet
he had committed suicide somehow those who were supposed to look into
these issues did not perhaps feel fit to be more questioning to be more
circumspect and to be more critical of the methods that the police used
	when we went to bethal eighteen of us were tried we had a list an
even bigger list of what you call coconspirators the first accused was
the late zef motobini and amongst the coconspirators the first was the
late president robert sebukwe the late who was then
on the defence council asked this is not funny here you have the
president of the one organization he’s the first coconspirator this
trial centers around this man and yet you are not he’s not being
charged why and indeed that was a big question but later we came to
know why because sebukwe did not have much longer to live maybe the
feeling was that if he’s charged and convicted he will then die in
prison and perhaps become a martyr or become the responsibility of the
prison department or of the government of the day
	that’s one possible reason why but to this day one cannot really answer
this question and more so you noted that somewhere i make a submission on
the role of the judiciary the conduct of the judiciary in our case at
the end of the trial i think none of us was really interested in what
was happening on the bench when sentence was passed judgement day
another concern was whether any death sentences were going to be imposed
or not not that we’ll have acquittals or there are certain changes on
the basis of the evidence that had been given
	there was no voluntary participation on the question of those who gave
evidence for the state firstly these people had been seriously
assaulted and we knew that we know of cases of people who were made to
spend some time in a mortuary where there were corpses of motor car
accident victims and these people were being brought to testify even
against their spouses the court gave a ruling that that witness could
give evidence against her own spouse that stood we were tried far away
from our homes and the question was why is it that we are being our
trial is being conducted so far away was it that we did not have
facilities in pretoria where the majority of the accused were we were
also interrogated very far away from our homes if during interrogation
maybe they pick up that there was a pamphlet a pac pamphlet somewhere in
attridgeville a car would be given and they would drive all the way from
pietermaritzburg to pretoria to pick up that onepage pamphlet and bring
	the people who were assembled there were referred to as a team and
amongst them were those who were called the pac team you have the anc
team because they were specialists in torturing and in dealing with
members of the different organizations particularly members of the pac
as it was facing us that time i noticed that some of the names of the
people who were part of the interrogating team have featured in other
incidences like the vlakplaas incident and so forth it was not
surprising that their names popped up there these men were sort of way
above the law they were way above anything in terms of authority they
felt that they ruled the roost they determined what happens to you
virtually they do not make it a secret that your life was in their hands
to survive you simply had to do as they expected you to do it was not
surprising that when we went and appeared in court the first thing that
was done was the state asked for the proceedings to be held in camera
	now we were being interrogated far away from our homes incognito and
some of us were not even informed about deaths in their
families i know of comrade ben ntwele he was not informed about his
mother’s death and similarly we were try tape ended
mr mjalane i know that you are you have requested us to
take a few cases related to people from alice where you are going to be
making representations on their behalf could you indulge us by allowing
us to complete this particular hearing by taking the badi case which is
very closely related to the case that we have been handling right up to
now i think it will not be long i know that you are not involved in
yes so we would like just to complete that and then come
back to the cases that you are going to be interested in thank you sir
elizabeth nowakhe badi together with eric badi
thank you mr chairperson i will swear them in elizabeth
they have been properly sworn in
we welcome you elizabeth badi and eric how are you related
is he going to help you give evidence
we are taking this case because it is related to the
previous one we are not going to start from the beginning mr sandi will
lead the evidence on behalf of the commission
thank you mr chairperson i do not want to waste your time we
will start with nowakhe badi you say on the th of october at home
in alice msobomvu what happened could you tell us please
on the th of october eric came at night knocked on my
window he said i must switch off my light he then told me that eric had
been shot and needs some clothing i took my sons clothing and threw it
out of the window eric then told me that my members of my family had
also been shot they did not find him there then these people knocked
and opened the door and they shot everybody in the house i asked them to
leave because i was scared that they were going to come to me
nontsikelelo came and knocked on my window had been shot she asked me
to open the door she told me that she had been shot in the legs i was
scared to switch on the light i took nontsikelelo put her under covers
gave her a nappy to bind her wounds i asked her if her upper body had
been injured she said no it was just her legs i asked what had
happened at home she told me that vuyokazi and nowinile had died shot
dead she told me that my father was alive
	we could not move because we did not know where the enemy was my
brother came knocked told me that my father as well had died tammy
also came who had run with eric they hired a car we took nontsikelelo
to hospital in alice my brother cobert was also in the car and we
dropped him off at the police station in alice to give a report and
statement there were bottles that my brother had picked up no there
were bullets that my brother had picked up i left them at the anc
office people who worked at fort hare came we told them what had
happened we were then taken the media came and we all went to msobomvu
the corpses had been taken by the police there was blood everywhere the
furniture was destroyed it was chaos
my niece vuyokazi was years old my father ben badi and
nowinile badi my parents had been shot
therefore it is the entire family practically
at the funeral were there police
the soldiers were at the graveyard there were police vans
was it usual that the police would attend these funerals
armed especially when there is a mass funeral
we did not trust them and this hurt us a great deal that they
did the police investigate this matter
they went to the hospital after that they never came to the
no because on the th of july in we were called in we
were told that they are still investigating the case and no perpetrators
therefore nobody was questioned or arrested
mr galane started investigating the matter he questioned some
people and he called us in actually to he said that we must come and
see the people who had damaged my home sandile mati madoda kula and
welcome maronono were there and they were identified as people who had
done the damage they were also in the newspapers the private
investigators the investigators it was madoda kula sandile mati and
is that all the evidence that you have is eric going to say
i was the first one to be shot at home it was after midnight
somebody knocked at the door somebody called out my name then he also
called out my nickname and i thought that my friend who uses this
nickname was in johannesburg i peeped through there was a man at the
door with a rifle this man carried on knocking i did not open the door
i was too scared i went back to bed then this man knocked at the
window he started shooting at the window i was shot twice at the thigh
and the leg i tried to hide he carried on shooting i jumped out of the
window he drove off he had done what he wanted to do
	i went to check on my brother when i got there he was not there the
window was opened i jumped out of the same window i went to our next
door neighbours my brother was there he was in a drum of water he then
leapt out of the water he helped me run because i was weak i said that
we must go to my sister when we got there i told my sister that people
at home had been shot before i got to my sister we heard sounds bullet
sounds exactly the way they sounded when i was being shot then a
grenade went off there was an explosion after he had shot at me as well
a grenade was shot was thrown when i got to my sister i told her what
happened we left my sister we went to a man from another village asking
for help he got a car that took me to hospital
do you know if there were people who were identified in
it is the same people that my sister had mentioned these were
the people that were shown at court
was there a case would you go to court
yes we would go to court but there was no case as such
sandile mati welcome and madoda kula
was mr galane investigating this matter
do you have requests in connection to this matter who were
we did not have any legal representatives
were you a member of any political organisation
were you members of the anc
is there somebody who threatened you are there people in the
village whose houses were burnt down or people who were shot
no it started with my family this was after the bisho massacre
is there something you would like to add if there is maybe
you can think about it as i will hand you over to the chairperson
how old was ben badi when he died
so who is at the badi home now
i am not married but i do not stay at home it is eric who
this was a painful day that you are reminding us of at
msobomvu i remember the funeral as we were going to bury the badi
family it was a day that we thought we would never heal from it was so
painful elderly people and a young child i am thankful to see you here
today because on the day of the funeral you never thought you would
survive but the lord has given you strength and you are able to come
before the commission i think this is one of the matters that the
commission will look at closely because i think alice will never be at
peace if this matter is not looked at closely and something is done about
it we are grateful that you are so strong and for having brought this
matter before the commission there were doubts that you would come
before the commission but we are grateful that you eventually came
because we know that something like this we cannot just forget about
until the truth has been found i am sure that your mother and father are
looking at you before us they know that even though they have passed on
you are here to represent them thank you you may step down
we did not ask them their request but it is okay i mean

mr chairman my client did make a statement it was signed
and it was given to this commission twofold to investigate the matter
further and to put certain questions to the witness i would like to read
	i the undersigned jibilikile khani do hereby declare i am a pensioner
presently residing at masel township kentononsea the contents
contained herein are except where otherwise stated to my knowledge and
belief both true and correct i was a member since of the then
south african police force and retired with the rank of sergeant during
 i have read annexure ecacd and wish to comment thereto as
follows i am of the opinion that the annexure is incomplete and
therefore i am unable to reply to same in a detailed manner david nazo
his family and myself are residents in kentononsea and we all know each
other i strongly deny that i was part of or present when david nazo was
allegedly arrested on or about january and january i was
informed on dates which i can now not remember that david nazo was
arrested in alexandria as well as in kentononsea i was never part of
or have never in kentononsea or any other place assaulted or tortured
	to establish and verify the allegations about the contradiction of tb i
would strongly suggest that the truth and reconciliation commission
investigate these allegations and then to refer same to a tb expert and
specialist i do not at this point in time deem it necessary to comment
further to the allegations as mentioned in the annexure and will do so if
necessary at the appropriate time and forum signed by the deponent j
khani that is all mr chair
thank you do you know why he preferred not to come himself
mr chairman the annexure that was provided was very
limited various names were mentioned and it was only given to myself on
friday last the fourth yes the fourth and without a thorough
investigation into this matter i could not advise him to come before
this commission at that point in time
are there questions okay we have noted the statement by mr
khani we will definitely be in contact with him through your office and
we would like to have an opportunity to find out the problems that he has
with the statement as it is and with the submission that we will make
available to him of the oral testimony that has been given here today
i he says that he is totally incomplete i do not know which parts are
missing which he would like to have from the witness but we will afford
him an opportunity to submit to us those parts which are missing and as
far as possible we would want to have his side of the story before we
make a finding if we are contemplating finding him as a perpetrator
we’d like to call mbongeni nicholas bam
i will lead you with questions mr bam are you going to talk
please tell us his story briefly
my brother disappeared on the th of april we did not know
his whereabouts after a while we heard that he left the country with his
other friends 	in ‘ and in i heard from one guy that there
were cadres who came to this country saying that my brother died in
exile we waited for more information from the anc because we expected
them to come to my home to explain how he got injured we waited until
 after the elections other cadres came back all this time i didn’t
tell my mother because i thought she would be shocked
you said that it was in 
he left the country in in i heard the news that he
died in we didn’t hear anything after that when other cadres came
back to the country i decided to tell my mother what happened because she
would hear that there were other cadres who were coming back and she
would enquire about her son i then told her because his friends were
also coming back when i told her i said that there were officers of the
anc who were supposed to come to my home to report this matter and they
said there is this person who is going to go door to door to the family
members of those who died in exile but up until today nobody came
this man phakamisa gulwa is he the one who told you your
phakamisa gulwa is he the one who told you that your brother
he said that they were shot in a firing squad and they were
did you go to an anc office to enquire about what exactly
i went everywhere i went to the anc offices in town and they
said i was going to meet mr ingalitsha but every time i went there i
could not see him i then contacted mxebe sebata and he said we were
going to meet in the anc offices when we got there he took me to another
guy who took my statement out and they said they were going to come to my
home but up until today they didn’t
	one day we were attending a funeral of a cadre in king william’s town
david may and i was shown that mr ingalitsha was there i said that i was
looking for him he was not in the office at that time we were just at a
funeral i said that i wanted to ask him something and he said yes i knew
sipho he was in lesotho he wanted me to give him my particulars as well
as my mother’s and they would do a followup i told him that my mother
was not well since this incident
thank you what would you like the commission to do for you
i think my mother will be satisfied if her son’s bones could be
exhumed so that she can rebury them
did your brother have a child
no he did not have any children
no secondly i would like the anc to come to my home to tell my
mother officially what happened to my brother
thank you i will hand over to the chairperson and maybe my
colleagues will ask you certain questions thank you
thank you mr chairperson mr bam where you here when mrs
did you hear when she said there were papers found in town
yes i do have a copy
was your brother mentioned in those papers
no except that it was written that sipho bam died in a certain
year in angola there is no further explanation
thank you mr bam thank you mr chairperson
mr bam mrs koliti is she here
mrs tonisi mr gobizembe and thembakazi tuku you’ve given us
very painful and a difficult task with the regard to the disappearance of
the people who were tortured those who were in exile under the anc i
would like to add that there are also other incidents mentioned about the
illtreatment of women who were there these are very painful stories to
	you also added that even though such incidents happened there were no
people who came to report to the family members in a dignified manner
about these incidents you’ve requested us to make an investigation and
to find answers so that we can forward them to you to inform you exactly
what happened to your people i would like to say that there is hope that
we might get these answers there’s hope because in the past few weeks
when the political parties appeared before the commission most of them
came before the commission and said that they did not know what happened
but i would like to say that the anc took a different position from other
political parties in that it came before the commission and it owned up
at the highest level instead of denying these incidents the anc has
already confirmed before the commission that these things did happen
these are not just accusations they are things that happened in exile and
it gave the commission other people’s names and we have to inform their
families that these people were brutally killed in anc camps in exile
secondly they have declared publicly that they are going to work with the
commission so that we can get answers to each and every case and report
back to the families i think this will help us answer your questions
	what is going to be difficult is to answer to the situations where other
political parties were involved because they denied their involvement but
we will try to find some answers we know that it is very painful that
other children came back to support and work for their families after a
long in exile others did not come back and some families do not know
whether these children are alive or not i hope that as the anc promised
in public that it will help us it will do so so that we can find out
these answers and so that we will be able to present before the president
	we thank you for being brave and coming forward to the commission thank
opens hearing with a hymn and a prayer
we are going to remember those that you’re going to talk
about those who have passed away in different ways we’ll light the
candle to reflect their presence amongst us as we are going to witness
	could you please stand while i read their names with reverence we
remember deric john whitfield boyce michael wheeler virginia panziso
jeff wabena gerge botha arnold gush leon meyer and jacqueline ann
quinn may they rest in peace lord and give them everlasting light amen
	we welcome everybody here today on the second day of our hearings in
east london we welcome those that are going to be testifying before this
commission those people who are going to tell l the stories of their
lives the oppression and depravation of their as human beings this
hearing today will be live on radio and we ask that you will cooperate

clear understanding of the hearings today

attorneys could please approach the panel so that we can give them a
stipulated time we are going to start with perpetrators with legal
representatives from midday however if there are people with special
requests or if they want to change their time they can approach the panel
so that we can organise it
	i’m going to hand over to miss maya to read the list of people who are
going to appear before the commission today

thank you mr chairman can i find out the name of the other
gentleman who is with neville he’s also neville thank you i’m going
to ask you to take the oath starting with the jnr you don’t have to

thank you we welcome neville belling junior and senior we
will ask mr sandi to direct some questions based on the statement that
you have supplied to the commission and give you a chance to state your
thank you mr chairman good morning mr belling let me say i’m
glad that we have eventually met because we’ve been doing a lot of
talking on the phone over the past few days to avoid confusion when i
ask a question to the father i will say mr belling senior and when the
question is directed to the son i will say mr belling junior as the
chairman of the panel has already stated i will ask a few questions the
idea is not to trick you or to try to say that your story is not true
the idea is simply to assist you to present your evidence to the
commission as it has been stated in your statement i’m not quite sure
how you’re going to present your evidence are we going to start with mr
belling the junior and then the father to assist him
okay mr belling junior as i go through your statement it
appears that you will be talking about the shooting which occurred at the
high gate hotel on the first of may is that correct
according to that statement you were one of the people who were
shot on that day is that correct
can i now hand over to you to tell the whole story how it
happened what you saw and so on
okay on saturday the first of may shortly before
ten pm my cousin roland parker and i arrived at the high gate hotel
east london on our arrival we immediately entered the bar and took up
seating at the bar counter near the doorway to the poolroom we then
ordered bears from the bartender and shortly after our drinks had arrived
i suddenly heard the sound of running footsteps approaching the entrance
i then turned my head to the right and looked directly at the bar
entrance where i then saw a black male person appearing in the doorway
this black male was wearing black trousers white shirt and a brownish
coloured jacket this black male was carrying a rifle in his hand the
make of which is unknown to me i’d just entered the bar area and having
just entered the bar area this black male came to a halt and he then
directed the barrel of the firearm to my position i then chose for my
wellbeing and dived to my left pulling my cousin roland parker to the
	on my crashing to the floor i suddenly felt that i had lost the feeling
of my left arm and at this stage i was looking away from the door and
although unable to see what was taking place i heard the gunman continue
to direct fire at the patrons in the bar while the shooting continued i
suddenly heard a loud explosion coming from inside the bar area after
which the light became dull i then suddenly heard something roll on the
floor behind me and fearing that this object was an explosive device i
braced myself for a further explosion no explosion came and i heard ssss
sound over the gunfire i then realised that teargas had been set off in
the bar and i was choking on the teargas shortly after my having
determined that the teargas was inside the bar area the shooting suddenly
ceased i then dragged myself into the conference room to escape the
teargas and was later removed from this area by the paramedics
	as a result of this attack i sustained injuries of a serious nature to
my left arm left hip and also internal injuries and i feel that nobody
had the right or permission to cause such injuries to me or attempt to
was anyone arrested in connection with this incident
noone has been taken to court on charges of having done this
no the guy my son identified he identified him from
photos that were shown to him long afterwards and then it was told to me
at a later stage that this very same guy that he identified as the guy
who actually did the shooting towards them was shot and killed in umtata
in a robbery case an armed robbery case there so apparently he was shot
then and they didn’t have any other person they didn’t catch anybody in
so nothing has happened by way of criminal prosecution
were you taken to hospital after the incident
can we talk about that part of it
when i arrived at casualty i had to wait for the
specialist to arrive i was conscious all the time at that stage they
only knew of my left arm that was shot because i was lying on my back and
i was busy complaining about back pain when the specialist arrived they
turned me over on my side and found three bullet holes in my back after
which they immediately rushed me to theatre by the time i got to theatre
i was unconscious as i had hardly had any blood in my body
are you receiving any medical treatment today for the injuries
well at this stage i’m going through six hundred
tablets a month for pain and sleeping i suffer from dizziness because of
the explosion the balancing of my ears was damaged
i understand from your statement you were twenty at the time of
were you a scholar or were you working
i was working at that stage
you’re not working at the moment
is that as a result of the shooting you sustained
is there anything mr belling senior that you want to add to the
he’s gone through a lot of pain and suffering he was
in hospital for a long long time and he’s been through numerous
operations three different operations his heart had stopped and they
battled to revive him due to the fact that all the operations he was
having he had up to three operations sometimes in one week which is too
much for an individual and this caused the heart muscles to weaken i
spoke to the anesthetist and he explain why they were very scared to
take him on at any stage to do any operations as there was a big problem
to operate on him because the fear was that he wouldn’t come out of the
anesthetic again he’s had a lot of damage to himself and the specialist
on the very first operation after the shooting told me that for the next
thirty years he’ll be going in and out or hospital for different
operations the damage is so bad to his hip that they cannot replace his
hip which needs replacement because a replaced hip only lasts for about
ten years and they can only replace it twice therefore he’s got to wait
until he’s in his fifties before he can have a hip replacement so until
then he has to suffer with that hip and other ailments that he’s got and
so on for which he is taking medication
	the other side which i’d like to mention to the commission is what must
be taken into consideration is his social lifestyle at his age i mean
these are things which sometimes we do not think about i’m discussing it
because he perhaps wouldn’t mention these things and to me it’s not funny
at all because at his age his friends are getting married and this type
of thing if you go that far right into it which is not very nice for him
living like that he’s sort of living on his own he cannot socialise
much in various places he’s also got a colostomy a permanent colostomy
which will never be changed that has been told to us in the doctors’
reports which i’ve given to the commission you can go through them at any
other stage and you can see what i’m getting at even the government on
the welfare side their panel of doctors booked him as eighty percent
disabled when they read these statements and i don’t why this has
actually taken so long i’d like to know to find out if the commission
can go further with it i have got statements here which i’ve sent in
long ago long before the truth commission was ever thought of i’ve been
working on this case ever since then but i never seem to get through to
anybody the first lot of documentation i sent through registered and so
on didn’t go through it just disappeared and nobody knew what was going
on i eventually thought i must get somebody in parliament to assist me
now that we can talk directly i eventually got hold of senator ray
radie everything with regard to what we’re discussing here you can refer
back to senator ray radie he helped us out a lot to get through so that
we can get into the truth commission we were supposed to be in the first
truth commission that came to east london but nobody called us up and the
week after they’d finished off then only they got hold of us which was
too late ray radie had already spoken to them about us going in there
otherwise we would have been through this truth commission then already
but the delays went on and on i’ve got letters here which i can show you
which was now recently last month that ray radie was sending to the
commission to get going with it and so on you know there’s the claims
that i’ve made you know which are claims to the commission for
compensation to him that is all on paper and i won’t mention that now if
you don’t want me to mention it but it is here you’ve got it all there
too because i’ve given it all in so we can go through those things
	on his side of it the basic fact is he is disabled for life he’s got no
social life anymore he’s got a future to look at ahead of him and to
look after him that is why i’ve made that claim so that he can look
after himself because my wife and i are not going to be around forever
also this whole issue here has turned our whole lifestyle upside down we
are completely in a shambles since this has happened it’s ripped us to
pieces and my wife is it’s taken twenty years out of our lives this
issue it was not funny at all and even now he’s got a lot of chances of
having heart attacks strokes and all this there’s a lot to take into
consideration and the medical side is a terrible issue because he’s now
suffering with all sorts of things he’s developed ulcers at a young age
	the other side of it is they changed the medication around to try and
prevent the ulcers but all this medication what about is kidneys
he’s got a chance of his kidneys collapsing and so on with all this
medication we’ve got to think of all these things it’s not you know
funny to even you can’t even sleep nice and so on he doesn’t sleep
properly he’s taking sleeping tablets he’s got to live on these things
and so on and he can’t even sit in one place even now he’s been
complaining that he’s getting a lot of pain again the hip is completely
shattered it looked like a spiderweb inside there and the specialist
said to me only nature can take it’s course now because they cannot put a
new hip in hip and he has to carry on suffering until he’s here in his
fifties which is a long time until he can get a new hip change you know
this is a very bad business and so on very bad
do i understand you to say that you are not happy with the
no the medical treatment is excellent but it’s the
amount that he’s got to take due to the damage that’s has been caused by
him being shot which is the big thing the thing is what i’m getting at
too is i’d like to mention to the commission that these were really
innocent people i’m talking about high gate king william’s town
queenstown and the st james church these were completely innocent people
they had no connections or anything to do with political or criminal
activities whatsoever i feel that these are the people that should be
brought in as priority do you understand they’ve never been in
political issues that there was cause for them to be shot and so on they
were completely innocent people completely innocent so i feel that all
in all those four i mentioned should be given priority do you
understand i don’t want to push other people away or anything but these
are the completely innocent people they had nothing to do with any
political issues at all that they got involved in those issues to be shot
or gave anybody any reason to shoot them there was no reason whatsoever
for these people to be shot completely on a social basis and they got
shot he went to his cousin and for the first time they went into a pub
they went to the kentucky fried chicken and on their way back they
decided to go and play a bit of pool these are not guys who go and live
in the pub they’ve not those type of guys they just went in there to go
and play snooker and they decided they will have a quick beer they
didn’t even have anything out of that beer i saw it with my own eyes i
even took video footage of the whole issue because i was in the force
myself and the blokes let me in there to have a look i know exactly what
that place looked like when i went in there everything was there their
change was lying there their cigarettes lighter and everything was
there in place where they fell when they got shot at that particular
place it was totally uncalled for it was completely uncalled for
are there any specific requests that you would like to raise to
this commission so that it can pass them over to the state president and
as far as i’m concerned the ball is in the court of the
government okay i say previous and present government the ball is in
their court and they must just pay out to compensate because there is an
act here that is in one of my statements there is a terrorists act i’ve
got that act in here where they should be paid out in any terrorist
activities and so on i’ve got it here i’ve given all these to the
commission too everything is there if you want to at some stage i can
go through it with you to point these things out and so on you know then
i can explain better on the issue
are you talking about the law pertaining to compensation to
we’ll talk a lot more about that when you show us the
documents is there any other specific request that you would like to 
i would like to request to the commission and you can
pass that over that these folks get compensated which i feel is no more
than fair that they get compensated for their injuries take a case like
him now or anyone else as a matter of fact i’d like to talk on behalf of
the other folks too but being injured like this is not funny in today’s
time the cost of living is going up and up heavily what’s it going to
cost in another twenty five or thirty years time terrible you know this
is not funny they can get that out they can sort something out he can
work on something that he can keep himself occupied do you understand
to make a little business or whatever he wants to do with it he can keep
himself occupied at the moment he can’t work and he’s on a very small
pension from the company which is very good he’s only on a very small
paid pension and he can’t live on that and then there’s the medical aid
which is assisting him yes but there is certain amounts he’s got to pay
out and he pays out of the pension side of it so what does he really get
out of his pension nothing he’s sitting and battling so he needs that
compensation which i feel is no more than right that the government pay
i’m sorry for the interruption mr belling before we conclude
and i hand you over to the chairman i see that in the statement there’s
something about psychological treatment would you like to explain that
yes he was sent in for psychological treatment to sort
of rehabilitate his mind and so on coming from that area of shock that
they went through has actually built up a lot of trauma in these guys and
still now it’s never to be forgotten he did go to doctor woods and he
went on treatment and then doctor woods said that there’s nothing much
that they can do for the simple reason that it’s got to be dealt with by
him personally that he himself is the only one who can rehabilitate
himself and sort it out this was after doctor woods had gone through
him i can give you the name too doctor woods treatment did not improve
any symptoms at all he did not improve after the treatment he had with
the psychologists so he did go through all that and the specialist
turned around and said he’ll have to go through with it but how long it’s
going to take him is another story but these guys cannot forget the stuff
thank you very much mr belling senior and mr belling junior if
there are any issues or information that you’ve forgotten to convey to
the commission you have time to do so when my colleagues from the panel
ask questions thank you very much sir thank you mr chairman
mr belling junior i just want to make a statement first and
then ask you a question i really do admire your courage in coming
forward today considering the pain that you are in now i want to
clarify one thing you are getting a disability grant is that correct
i’m not getting a disability grant i’m getting a
you’re getting a pension from your work right the second
thing is just to ask you quite a personal question relating to how you
actually feel about this matter yourself we’ve heard a lot from your
father about his feelings about it can you just tell me what you feel
even if it’s contradictory to what your father might have said
i feel very bitter about it as my father said i’ve got
no social life and i’m the age of twenty four now i see my friends go
ahead enjoying their life which i can’t do at this stage
your father mentioned that should there be compensation you
might consider having a small business end of tape
just one question to mr neville belling junior it’s a
question about your attitude towards this process of perpetrators of
extreme acts of violence coming forward to own up to what they’ve done
what will your feeling be when a person who is responsible for destroying
your life in the manner in which it has been destroyed if you were to
come forward and confess and ask for amnesty
i don’t in my opinion feel that they should get
amnesty if they knew what we went through the pain and the suffering
the pain you can’t explain it’s unexplainable i can’t explain the pain i
went through there were days when i felt as if i was dying and i was
dying at some stage and it’s hard to forgive a person for that for what
your attitude would be that having gone through what you have
gone through those who are responsible for these acts must face the
consequences of that by going to jail and serving their full sentence
mr belling senior you are a father to your son and you are
able to articulate the pain that the family has gone through i would
want to direct the same question to you how do you see this
i see it in the same light because they knew before
they went there what their intentions were interrupted
they knew before they went there what their intentions
were so to me it’s a premeditated issue they’d already planned it because
according to the witnesses i won’t mention it now but according to the
witnesses there these people were sitting and having something to eat
there and they got up and opened their jackets and they just or
opened up the butts of the ak’s and then they took off and that’s when
they started shooting so they were there long before they had already
sized the whole place up these guys knew what they were doing before
they even went there they knew what their intentions were so there’s no
argument that it was done on the spur of the moment or anything like
that what he’s gone through is terrible this guy had septicemia he
nearly died like he said he nearly died a couple of time without the
heart problems the one specialist phoned me at twenty to six on a
saturday morning i’ll never forget it and he said to me mr belling i’ve
got to rush your son into theatre because if we don’t operate he’s going
to die and if we do operate he’s only got a fifty percent chance now you
must hear something like that it’s not funny really it’s not funny this
	my wife was working and came home at night we had a nurse looking after
him for five days a week because he had a huge hole and i’m not
exaggerating of that size on his leg they had to drain it three or four
times a day and their was an ak bullet in the leg and every time they
xrayed i marked of the xrays and so on the bullet had disappeared in
the meantime it was moving up and down his leg we’ve got the bullet i
should have brought it with me it was corroded and a badly corroded
bullet this is the type that the terrorist used they come out of all
the filthy places and i know because i’ve dealt with this before anyway
with all the septicemia and so on he nearly died a few times and they had
to operate on him and this was terrible things he had to go through he’s
had many operations on his hip the authopedics had to sort him out this
guy went through endless pain and then my wife had to deal with him when
she came home because the nurse went off many of the times she’d work
right through the night with him and went back to work the next day with
no sleep this was killing to all of us it wasn’t funny at all we had no
lifestyle at all there was no ways we could go out or anything like that
not that we were people to do that but saturdays sundays and right
through the nights we went on and on with him to fight with him i even
built everything an authopedic bed at home even on top of that monkey
chain i built all of that because i’m a versatile guy i can do welding
and that type of thing i made all these things better than what they had
in hospital i had everything there that he could try to do exercises
with weights we went through everything and everything costs money i’ve
got no money left either because of all this my money is also finished
we spent everything on him it runs into money all the time it just runs
into thousands of rands and it doesn’t stop it doesn’t stop at all
	i’m just trying to explain to the commission how we went through this
whole issue and we still have got problems with him and he still goes to
the doctors now and again although he’s settled down a lot our biggest
problem is all this pain that he has that he lives with he’s got to
take six hundred tablets a month which is not very funny at all he’s
forced to take them he’s got to take them otherwise he can’t move around
in any way he’s still on crutches and he’ll be like this and suffer like
this until he’s fifty odd he’s got a colostomy bag too that’s not a
funny thing to have either because you can’t be in company with a
colostomy bag and this type of thing there’s nothing nice about it at
all we went through compete hell with this issue really and it’s just
buggerd our whole life up completely it’s messed our whole life up
	i feel that the government should look at compensating these people we
were talking about a little business it might be something small that he
can keep himself and his mind occupied so that he can try and drift away
from this issue that he’s been through because it’s never going to leave
him completely even his cousin that was with him if something bangs
next to him this guy takes off like a bullet and he goes down on his
tummy he’s still very very nervous this guy he’s been going for
treatment too but he was the worst hit out of them all except for those
people that were shot and killed and also those who lost like webber
lost his arm and so on and doreen and these people they also got badly
injured he was really the worst hit he was living in hospital all the
time all the operations he’s had is unbelievable i’ve handed all the
reports from all the specialists to the commission so that you people can
go through them and study them whenever you like i’ve given you copies
of that then you’ll really see what he went through
thank you very much mr belling senior you have referred to
this as a premeditated act of brutal murder
and you have given us a glimpse of the kind of suffering that
your family went through and how your life has been totally changed by
one act of brutal even mad act of murder you have referred to people who
are victims of the high gate murder and king william’s town and
queenstown in this region and the church in cape town you say that those
people who are responsible for this must really be taken to court and
face the consequences of their actions would you say the same for all
people who have committed acts of murder during the conflicts of the past
or would you feel that these four cases should be treated differently
from the rest of the cases
i feel personally that it’s an act of cowardice because
they’re hitting soft targets so called soft targets these so called soft
targets are targets where there’s no firing back those people have not
firearms with them and that is why they go in and attack those people
that they know that can’t fire back at them and then they take off and
run away but if somebody does shoot back at them and i’ve see it with my
own eyes already they run right out of their boots to get away they even
throw their firearms away the thing is these four places i feel that
they were real honest soft target areas
	take the church for instance there they’re serving the lord this is
where our big problem is that we have in this country too because satan
is leading everything and we must realise that the only way there is
going to be peace or any peace that will come only one way and that is
everybody opens their hearts to the lord that’s knocking on that door
then only then there will be peace otherwise there will be no peace and
that is for sure they allow satan to take over and guide them and put
everything into their heads and that’s exactly what is happening and we
bypass that issue by not looking up to the lord and having the powers and
the spirits of the lord upon you then only you will be in a safe
situation but then you have to carry on otherwise satan chases you all
the time he insisted to be baptised on the twenty eighth of february
 and he insisted to be baptised in a new church of ours that opened
up and then he was shot in that may and i explained to them afterwards
that is where satan is chasing you this is one of the reasons where you
got involved in that how did he get out of all this only by prayers and
the lord’s powers to guide the specialists to do the operations to get
him through that’s the only thing that brought him through we’ve got to
look upon the lord instead of looking at all these wild things that’s
going on it’s all satan that’s driving these things into everybody that
is the big mistake we are looking at whereas if we open our hearts to the
lord let him come in then we will have peace in the world not only here
in south africa i’m talking about the world look right around us at what
is going on the most terrible things are happening cruel things that
one would never even have imagined seeing i would like to say that those
four areas are real soft targets they should never have just been hit
like that that was a cowardly act as far as i’m concerned these people
should be sorted out in a very harsh manner as to what the law takes it
to that’s what i’d like to see because these people are all in a bad
situation especially a church how can they go and hit on a church
they’re going to answer to the biggest judge of all and that’s god our
father in heaven that’s the one they’re going to answer to for sure
sure they’re going to all answer to him so we’re not even worried what
happens here that day is coming we will all go through that day that
day’s coming and judgement will be done all those perpetrators they will
for ever live in condemnation that’s for sure we look upon it that way
thank you mr belling last question reverend xundu
just to get the thing into perspective for my understanding
you are saying that all perpetrators should go the same route of being
taken to court be they sharpeville where people were just massacred
without having guns be they june the sixteenth shall we raise those
names and say the amnesty process is irrelevant because i think that you
are making a statement which i think makes the amnesty process an
irrelevant process in terms of reconciliation for south africa i just
want to get it on record that you are saying that all those people who
have been perpetrators like in sharpeville on june the sixteenth who
suffered at the hands of the police and maduna state in uitenhage were
just mowed down that those people who committed that in your opinion
should not be granted amnesty they should be charge and imprisoned
well they did the damage they should have thought
first and thought about the lord first before they did things like that
they are doing acts and deeds for satan himself it’s acts of satan that
is going through what he puts in their minds and they
should have thought of that fist but to take an act like that and put it
into action like if i had to go and start mowing people down here then i
should be sorted out for that never mind who he is who the person is
they should be sorted out according to the laws of the country it should
be sorted out and i feel the maximum should be dealt with with these
people because this is not the way that we should be living that is why
there is all this conflict i don’t care who the person is white or black
there’s no discrimination with me at all i look at the criminal that’s
what i look at i don’t care who he is if he’s done wrong he’s done wrong
and that’s it so then they should be sorted out
mr belling thank you very much thank you mr belling junior
you have told us that you are in extreme pain and i don’t know whether
you are going to wait for the rest of the high gate testimonies to be
heard or do you want us to release you straight away there are still
four more other people from the high gate incident who want to testify
are you going to remain or do you want to be released
you’ll remain thank you very much i will convey a word of
thanks to you all after you’ve all testified
could i ask one other questions with all due respect
to the commission is it not going to take another four years before we
hear of any progress i’m saying this with all due respect to the
commission because this had been a nightmare i’ve even got more grey
hairs that my other grey hairs in these four years
the matter is completely out of our hands mr belling what we
do is to take the information from victims compile a report to the

is concerning what happened to you is that correct
we have a date here is the th of july 
where your home was attacked and one person died inside the
house and certain police were injured are you going to talk about that
please tell us briefly what happened on that day
on the th of july matemba and i got up in the
morning matemba vuso i was preparing to come to highway to have my
shoes repaired at the shoemaker i left him behind cleaning i went to
highway and i did all that i was supposed to do on my return as i was
using the main road up to mount ruth i got to the tjunction joining the
way from cecilia makiwane hospital i heard a noise when i looked towards
the right i found that the children from hosanah college toyitoying
there was someone standing next to me i asked him what was going on and
he pointed in front of me and said i must look as i looked there was a
hippo a casspir turning towards the main street going to mount ruth at
the time there was a group of soldiers walking down from people’s houses
as i was trying to figure what was going on this casspir went from house
to house i thought that they’d got lost it went into the fourth house
i walked into a house opposite this casspir and a white policeman came
towards me pointing a gun at me saying that i must get out of the way i
tried to go back home but as i turned right going home i turned left
again going straight home as i got into the street i saw that there were
a whole lot of white cars ford sierra’s and ford escourts i walked right
past and i had a bag with me i looked at my house and i realised that my
fencing had fallen apart outside my house there were blankets and
bedspreads i walked past my house i walked past my house steven
knipe i left my bag there with tammy and i told him that i would
come back there were a whole lot of things going on 	even though i was
there by mistake i told myself that i was going to go to the border
council of churches as i was going up the road a child called out to me
this child told me about his brother who was in exile they were fighting
over the phone the one wanted to phone the sister and tell her what was
happening they said that i must go and help with the dispute i did not
realise at the time that this house was the house where the hippo had
gone in and when i went there it caused my arrest as i went down the
road a ford escourt came driving very fast and when it came close to me
about six metres it braked but drove past i thought i better not run
away else they would shoot at me this car reversed and stopped right in
front of me and a man got out of the driver’s seat it was mhleli whom i
knew he would come to my aunt at mgwane on holiday
he is mfunani mhleli said that i’d grown up at his home
even though he was the one who was going to my aunt mhleli was my
he was a security branch officer
could we revert back please please tell us what exactly
happened on this day you said that you saw your fence was down
the security officers and soldiers were at my house looking
was there an mk member in your house
what did you eventually find out happened at your place
matemba passed away i was taken back to my house van wyk
was there with captain mfundisi captain van wyk had my marriage
certificate and pictures and asked if that was my documentation and i
said yes he showed me two policemen that had passed away he then took
me to a corner where matemba was lying dead i did not see anyone though
did you eventually find out how he died
i got his story when a state witness mr mxhata gave
evidence he gave evidence about me in court he said that he was on the
lookout and kept on hiding behind a wall but got shot he said he’d been
have you given us this name
after you were shot at home what happened to you
van wyk said that mfundisi must take me to the police
station and they must make sure that i divulge
and when you got to this police station
they took me towards the security section and i went in
there was a passage and some rooms with doors closed i was not given a
good reception as i was beaten up with all the weapons they had in their
hands they told me to go in but i didn’t know what they were talking
about because the doors were closed eventually a door was opened and i
went into this room where there was an elderly man who strangled me
saying that the police are dead and they tried to stop him he told me to
mr bikitsha the people who were assaulting you did you know
any of them or can you identify any of them
did you give us details about them
i have a list of their names
can you please give us the names of those you remember
mxhata delait mazewa swelindaho mfundisi and bouti
thank you mr bikitsha are there any people on that list that
bouti and mtatha are in higher ranks now
thank you for how long were you detained
how were you treated during that time
 the treatment i got after the
interrogations we wrote autobiographies and they left us alone we
and we saw the doctor agweno we made a claim and we were told that he is
the ciskei but he’s still in cecilia makiwane even today
is there anything else you would like to add before i as you
for your requests or your expectations
yes there is something i would like to add the government
robbed us because we won our claim an out of court settlement firstly
we were robbed because we were sent to the magistrate and instead of
coming and checking our situation he talked to us as if he was talking to
children secondly the doctor was said to be missing and our folders
were missing but the doctor was there they made this up so that we would
not be able to claim my house was damaged as well
please give us the name of the magistrate
thank you what are your requests or what do you expect the
first of all i would like these people to come forward with
their side of the story so that we can hear their side of the story
secondly as the situation was like it was there were no doctors that
were helping us we were not treated properly and we were tortured the
single cells in which we were kept had no windows we were then
transferred to solitary confinement in prison and we needed medical
treatment because we suffered from stress and from torture thirdly my
house and my properties i got three thousand rand and i could not
even buy enough clothes to wear with that kind of money
thank you mr bikitsha i will now hand over to the chairperson
and maybe you will be asked questions thank you
thank you mr chairperson mr bikitsha you mentioned certain
names in your statement and when you were talking you didn’t mention
these names who was mr nonhonho
did he take part in this process
yes he did because i was tortured by mnandana their
subordinate they pretended to be better and i went to nonhonho they
also had documents of people who were in exile they interrogated us
what did mr nonhonho do to you
he was instructing these people to do the things they were
doing to me they were in his command
when you’re talking about these people are you talking about
mtatha the late mazilwa swelendao mfundisi and bouti
mr bikitsha i have only one question for you you are talking
about doctors you were tortured and then you were taken to the doctors
do you have a medical report to substantiate the allegation of
no we were never given a medical report we went to abes a
coloured guy when we were released but i don’t know if he’s still around
the second question i want to know what kind of torture was
firstly they used a cube they tortured us daily for the
two weeks that we spent there they also used a they would
handcuff our arms and our legs and they would put something between your
knees and your hands and then they’d put two tables together and put you
between those tables with your head upside down this affected my arms
and my legs if you were tall enough so that your had touched the floor
they would lift the two tables so that you can hang at the time you
would have nothing on top and they would push you and beat you with a
what did you refer the one you just mentioned to
who were torturing you do you know their names
there were many of them but bouti and mtatha were also there
there are a number of perpetrators you’ve mentioned all of
them will come forward to deny that they were involved so your evidence
must clearly clarify who did this to you or were your eyes closed
at the time i didn’t know them but as i was in prison i got
to know them they were doing one thing at the same time they were not
sending each other all of them were eager
lastly mr bikitsha you mentioned boyce nokalema
thomas as the witnesses are these your witnesses were they detained
with you or what are they witnessing
boyce is not a witness we were charged
together nokalema was the one who hired a lawyer magqabi for me he
applied for a grant to pay for my house from the border council of
thank you for saying that you received a grant from the border
council of churches because i’m from there were you tortured alone was
there no one who can witness this
in the torture room you would be alone
i think this is my last question you said that at home there
was a person who was a member of umkhonto wesizwe were you a member of
i received training inside i received my training inside
my question was were you a member of umkhonto wesizwe
no i was not a member of umkhonto wesizwe
thank you very much mr bikitsha we apologise for asking you
many questions but we have to get clarity because you’ve mentioned a lot
of people’s names and these people would like to appear before the
commission to deny these allegations we have to get clarity so that we
are able to know what the real truth is i would like to thank you for
now you may go back to your seat
we will call three people who want to state their side of the
story regarding zwelakhe bikitsha’s evidence the first one is mr mhleli
mfunani who will be with his legal representative mr mbandazayo mr
mbandazayo please confirm your name and the name of your client and the
reason why you want to appear before the commission today
mr chairman i confirm that i am lungelo mbandazayo
 and i’m representing mr mhleli mfunani 
thank you mr mhleli mfunani we would like you to take an
oath we thank you for coming here to give us your side of the story with
regard to mr bikitsha’s evidence reverend xundu will help you take the
mr mbandazayo please proceed with your client
mr chairman as usual you have before you main points which
my client will give evidence on and i will start asking him to give
evidence on those points mr mfunani you have heard the complainant mr
bikitsha giving evidence regarding the circumstances of the day in
question can you before the commission and in your own words tell the
commission what happened on the day in question
i can do that sir thank you mr chairperson first of all it
is true that the witness who was here we used to live together a lot of
times secondly mr chairperson on this particular day i was working in
bisho and i had just been promoted after writing police examinations i
was at the head office in bisho at the time
	on this particular day i was with late captain maganuga coming to
mdantsane to the security offices there and we had no idea of any
operation we got to mdantsane and there was a joint operation we went
with the late captain maganuga to the office and asked what was going on
we heard that we were going to nu to at the time i was not aware
whose house this was but out of curiosity we followed the police when we
were near kyalatemba we heard gunshots from nu we were standing near
kyalatemba after the gunshots stopped we went nearer if i remember
clearly when i arrived there there were police and soldiers i don’t
remember the police who asked me but i was asked to take the injured
police to cecilia makiwane which i did i came back from cecilia makiwane
hospital because i wanted to know what happened i was shown the police
who died and one guy from exile i don’t remember who said this but i
received a message that i was called over the police radio i don’t
remember if it was the commander of mdantsane but he said that the owner
of this house was mr zwelakhe bikitsha and as i was the person who knew
him i had to help them arrest him which i did as a policeman i arrested
mr bikitsha together with other police but i don’t remember who they were
	after that i left him in mdantsane security branch and i never met with
him again fortunately mr chairperson he didn’t even mention that i was
the one torturing him i met him again in court that is all mr
thank you mr mfunani if you have no objections we are going
to ask you a few questions mr mfunani i think that your statement is
very clear but i just want to know when you got to mdantsane security
branch offices to whom did you hand mr bikitsha over to
to the captain who was mr mhlangabise at the time
is mhlangabise the first name or surname
it mhlangabise mfundisi the surname is mfundisi
you then met him again in court
who handed him over to you when you met in court
i met him in court on the day when he was charged he
appeared in court because he was charged but i don’t remember whether it
was on this day that i testified but i did testify because i submitted a
statement as i was the one who arrested him
thank you mr chairperson mr mfunani we have a problem with
time so i would like you to be very brief in your answers if you can you
can just say yes or no thank you mr chairperson let me start by asking
this what is your rank in the police force now
i left the police force as a major in 
when did you joint the police force
in your career as a policeman in ciskei you’ve come across
various incidents like bus boycotts and others is that correct
at the time of the bus boycott were you a policeman
lets proceed without wasting any time do you know mr bikitsha
we were staying in the same house
why then is he accusing you of this
i think that he’s accusing me because i was the one who
did you speak to each other after the incident of this arrest
did you meet with each other
i met him in court mr chairperson
did you not meet after that
is it the first time that you see him today after appearing in
i used to see him in the street when i was driving my car
you never spoke to each other
why then is he accusing you of this were you in conflict
mr chairperson i said that he may be accusing me because i
was the one who arrested him if you listened very carefully when he was
testifying he never mentioned my name as one of the people who were
thank you mr mfunani i’m very sorry that we do not have enough
thank you mr mfunani we are not making any findings
concerning this matter when we take a decision to include your name as a
perpetrator in this case we will inform you so that we can get more
representation from your side if you so wish but for now we thank you and
are you not appearing for mr mfundisi
i think mr nompozolo is appearing for captain mfundisi
mr nompozolo is his surname he is appearing superintendent
i’m very sorry you are excused let us ask mr umhlangabise
mfundisi to come forward i’m sorry we got wrong information could you
introduce yourself and introduce your client
thank you mr chairman mr chairman my name is lindile
nompozolo from nompozolo attorneys in east london
how do you spell that no the first name is okay the surname
and you are appearing for mr umhlangabise mfundisi
thank you very much sir thank you for appearing before the
commission mr mfundisi please stand to take the oath reverend xundu
mr mfundisi we have your statement and we’ll hand over to you
mr nompozolo to lead the witness in evidence
thank you mr chairperson what is your rank
and on the sixteen of july what was your rank
who was your employer at that time
the ciskeian police the government of the ciskei
on the day in question we have already heard that there was
a raid or a mission can you confirm your role there
there was indeed a raid and my role was to be the commander
of the entire raid i had to answer to all questions and see to it that
the raid went smoothly i was a specialist in weapons therefore i had to
the testimony of mr zwelakhe bikitsha says that you
instructed mxhata to take him to the police station and to make him talk
what is your answer to that
it is true i gave mxhata orders to take him to the police
station whoever i did not say that he must make him talk
the evidence of bikitsha alleges that you and other
policemen tortured him although he was not specific
i have never tortured him in any way
are there questions do you have any objection to us asking
i just want to ask one question according to your knowledge
with a long record of being a policeman do you think anybody was tortured
by the police or people’s rights were violated by the police or have you
it would happen some people would be charged and sentenced
and some people would even be killed there are those who do not appear
would it happen that if you wanted information from someone
yes it would happen but not daily
thank you mr chairperson i did not understand your answer to
reverend xundu clearly as people started laughing
it would happen that people were beaten but not daily what
i’m saying is it would depend on the people that are beating the person
up and why i cannot be specific and say so and so was beaten or why that
thank you mr chairperson perhaps mr chairperson you would
allow me to make this statement before i ask questions the alleged
perpetrators remind me of a book i once read in which it said there are
it is not me i do not know anything about it and i do not
let us go back to the methods used when people are being
interrogated what methods would be used to interrogate people
let me rectify this i did not say that it is when people
are arrested it only happens sometimes
let’s talk about people who are arrested somebody who is being
interrogated maybe the police wanted information from that person how
would you ascertain that you get cooperation from the prisoner
according to the law one would interrogate the person by
questioning beyond that would not be according to the law
as a policeman can you tell me what methods would you use to
interrogate people that are arrested if you wanted information from a
prisoner what method would you use
i personally would be very careful especially if the case
was mine because i would want the case to be successful i would not
interrogate a person without information i would rather leave that
person i would succeed because as i interrogate this person it would
come across that i know more than the prisoner
mr mfundisi the questions that we would ask as the commission
are not because we do not know the answers to the questions each witness
appearing before us would swear and be on oath to tell the truth even
though we have the answers but because we want to ascertain the
truthfulness of the person we ask questions to who gave orders on this
day when you were commanding the raid as i need clarity here
what orders or instructions about the raid or what
as a commander of this particular unit where did you receive
your instructions from what were you supposed to do and where please be
patient sir and wait for me to say i’m finished i’m through
a week before the raid white men from the security branch
in east london came telling me that there is an anonymous letter which
they received and this letter contained information about the security
police the letter alleged that we wanted matembo umwuso who stayed in
the house of a certain mr bikitsha this person proceeded saying that we
must raid this house as there are arms and explosives which are unlawful
and this person was at home most of the time especially during the day
however at night this person goes out this person said he wanted to get
rid of the person with the illegal arms i asked for this letter but it
was not given to me and i was then requested by the security branch
officers from east london to help them find this man i was a bit
concerned because this was not the usual way of getting information it
probably was someone who was close to this family or who knew them very
well but the question was who was this person i took the telephone
directory there was only one bikitsha that was listed next to mount ruth
i was a bit confused because a second bikitsha came up within the area
somebody phone saying that this anonymous person phoned again and this
person was urging us to make this raid this time i got the chance to
read the letter we did not know whether this was a trap and we did not
know who bikitsha was we summoned a task force and handed this over to
them after the task force had searched the house we would be allowed to
search the house it was who would lead this
excuse me mr mfundisi you have answered me i just wanted to
know where you got the orders from apparently you got this from the
republic of south africa even though you were the police of the republic
of ciskei let us conclude this matter you said you are an expert where
order please we are not in a circus we are in a hearing order
i’m not sure what you’re saying
when did you become an expert in explosives
thank you mr chairman i won’t take this any further
thank you mr mr mfundisi you were
listening when do you confirm that you arrested mr bikitsha
did you confirm that mr bikitsha was handed over to you after
was this at mdantsane security offices
i think there is a mistake when he was arrested i was
still at mr bikitsha’s house conducting the search what caused the delay
was as a person in charge after the whole raid i would have to give a
detailed report to the head office and wait for the photographers
therefore i was still there he then he came saying that he has this mr
bikitsha and that is how he was handed over to me
therefore you are disputing the fact that he was taken to
mdantsane security police and handed over to you
i think there’s a mistake there it didn’t happen that way
why are you sentencing him aren’t you making a mistake
who had a higher rank you or mfunani who was superior
who was in charge of detainees clarify
lets start here if somebody is arrested because he is a
threat to the security according to section of the ciskei it is the
sir we are not talking under general here please lets not
waste time we are not under general here we are talking about a specific
person that is mr bikitsha who was in charge of the detention of
bikitsha for purposes of interrogation the evidence which has been
placed before us is that he was handed over to you
the person that was in charge was the person heading the
security the person who was responsible at the time was colonel nonhonho
why did it take us so long to tell us it was colonel nonhonho
therefore it was not you it was colonel nonhonho and so if we want to
know the truth about this whether mr bikitsha was violated we should as
if bikitsha’s rights were violated you would get an
who was more senior between the two of you
perhaps i can elaborate i’ve a copy of bikitsha’s detention
he was detained by sergeant zinzile on instructions of colonel nonhonho
this is the extract of the ob
mr mfundisi we are going to request that we go into greater
detail with you later we do not make a finding yet as we need a lot of
clarity on this matter we will send you a notice of section and
request that you appear before us to give us more detail and clarity for
now we give you a break until we meet under section thank you
are you appearing for mr mtatha as well mr mtatha please mr
nompozolo could you please identify yourself again and tell us who your
my name is lindele nompozolo and i’m from nompozolo
 attorneys from east london i’m representing
thank you very much mr umshlobo mtatha we would like you to
mr nompozolo we’ve got a written statement from mr mtatha and
we would like you to lead him with questions
is it correct that you are employed by the south african
yes that is correct i’m an inspector
on the sixteenth of july were you employed by the
i was a sergeant in the security branch
can you cast your mind back to the events of the sixteen of
july particularly about the raid which took place at house number
yes i can do that sir
there somebody was killed and a number of policemen were
a suspect was arrested do you know the name of the suspect
yes i do know the name
do you know who arrested him
after the arrest what happened to bikitsha
he was arrested by major mfunani and i escorted him to the
police station where i handed him over to the other police but i was
in you affidavit you have attached an extract from the
can you read to the commission what was written at 
detention sergeant zinzile details blackmail zwelakhe
bikitsha under section instruction from colonel nonhonho
thank you you heard the allegations from mr bikitsha that
you were one of his assailants
yes i did hear those allegations
what do you say to that
after he was detained did you ever have contact with him
i gave him clothes to change that’s when i saw him
no i was never his investigating officer
thank you mr chairman there’s just one point i left out mr
chairman he indicated to the commission that you were given instructions
by the then captain mfundisi to take him to the police station and to
thank you very much mr mtatha in your last answer you said
that he was making a mistake he made a mistake in that you were
instructed by captain mfundisi but he was assaulted by mr nonhonho
he’s making a mistake by saying that i was given instructions
by captain mfundisi to torture him so that he can talk because captain
mfundisi on that day couldn’t give us instructions because there was a
mr nompozolo do you want to consult with your client
just switch of the mike whilst you are consulting
thank you mr chairman the witness wants to rephrase his
i never got such instructions the instruction i got was to
escourt a car to the police station not to torture him so that he can
thank you are there questions reverend xundu
mr chairperson when a person had been arrested the police
would say that we would make you talk didn’t you hear the use of such
terminology in connection with people who were arrested
sometime a person would be asked questions concerning a charge
you said sometimes what would happen at other times
or he would be instructed to write down what he was saying
he would not be assaulted he would just be told and given tea
and be told to write down because we wanted the truth from him
secondly you said you were present in the raid on the house
no i did not shoot sir
i don’t remember during that operation except for those who
were inside the yard i think those were the ones who shot but of those
that were with me nobody shot
there was no order that you must shoot
no there was no order as colonel who was superior in that
operation there was no order saying that we must shoot
so those that did use their weapons shot out of their own
yes because they saw the situation fit
they took the law into their own hands
thank you mr chairperson mr mtatha i have two questions for
you first of all the copy of the occurrence book attached to your
affidavit what is the purpose thereof is it because you know the person
who wrote this occurrence or do you want to clarify to us who arrested
i wanted to clarify who arrested him and who took him to
according to this extract it is said that mr bikitsha was
arrested under the orders of colonel nonhonho do you have any knowledge
according to this section section when you read it is said
that the person who has a right to arrest a person is a colonel and his
superiors the subordinates do not have a right to arrest a person
you gave us this statement saying that instructions were from
colonel nonhonho do you have any knowledge of that let me leave that
question and say that you heard inspector mfundisi saying that the person
was responsible for the detainees was colonel nonhonho is that correct
in other words if a person arrested for interrogation colonel
nonhonho would have a knowledge of that
i may be wrong when i refer to the affidavit of colonel
nonhonho because he is not here but i’m going to ask this question as
you gave me the right to ask because of the extract extract from
some weeks later whilst on leave i was
informed that zwelakhe mr bikitsha had been arrested he said that he
knew about that mr bikitsha had been arrested some weeks later but your
extract said that mr bikitsha was arrested under section under
instructions from colonel nonhonho can you please explain this to us
he wants to consult with mr chairman thank you
mr nompozolo if you don’t mind i would like to withdraw the
unless you insist on answering the question because the
statement being referred to is the statement of colonel nonhonho he’s the
one who made the statement but what we want to know from mr mtatha
perhaps now is he confirming that mr nonhonho was present and is he
confirming that mr nonhonho did instruct the detention of and you
must remember that he is under oath
according to the ob extract mr chairperson i do confirm
because it is written this way according to the ob extract
the question asked was do you confirm that mr nonhonho gave
you the instructions and did he give you these instructions while he was
on holiday or was he present
mr chairperson according to the ob extract as this was written
by one member of the security branch it is very difficult for me to know
whether this member who signed this ob extract because we’d be given
instructions and told to do a job at that particular time
you saw the police who were in that operation was mr nonhonho
because i was busy on that day and i was shocked because there
were bullets all over i’m not sure whether he was there or not
mr mtatha we thank you for now as i’ve already said to mr
mfundisi who testified before you we are going to give you notices with a
view to an indepth investigation on this matter we are not
contemplating making a finding at this stage which would want to declare
you a perpetrator we would want to hold a more indepth hearing after we
will have more time to go indepth on this matter what you have said now
remains on our records and we will be using that in a section hearing
thank you mr nompozolo for your assistance you may be excused
lastly we want to read mr nonhonho’s statement for the record
he’s not here but his attorney mr clarke sent us his statement for the
record so that when we look deeper into the matter we have his statement
on record mrs crichton will read this statement for us
 i was previously employed as a major general in the former ciskei
 police prior to my appointment as major general in fact shortly
 after i was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel i was placed
 as head of the security branch		 	
 shortly before the arrest of zwelakhe bikitsha a typed letter was
 received by the security police in cambridge informing them that
 there were people with firearms and explosives at zwelakhe’s house
 this information was sent to my head office in bisho and i was sent to
 when i arrived on the scene i saw that two members of the police
 had been murdered and another person with an ak in his hand was
 some weeks later whilst i was on leave i was informed that
 zwelakhe had been arrested i had nothing to do with his arrest and i
 deny the allegations contained n his charge against me
 i cannot understand why this matter is being brought to the truth
 and reconciliation commission this matter was previously finalised in
 the bisho high court the matter was finalised under case number
 when zwelakhe received an undisclosed sum from the ciskei
 government in full and final settlement of his claim
 therefore submit that there is absolutely no reason for this
 matter to be brought before this commission
dated at east london this day of june 
thank you we regret that mr nonhonho decided not to avail
himself to us to answer a very pertinent question arising out of his
statement one of which is the one that has been alluded to by miss maya
but we are hoping that we will be able to meet with him under section 
of the act and converse with him further on what he has said in his
statement thank you very much we’ll adjourn and meet tomorrow at half
we would like to call on pralene mora botha welcome is it
pralene we thank you for coming forward to give your testimony
to the commission today i see you have someone accompanying you is she
is she going to be giving evidence as well
mrs parrot is it necessary for me to give evidence as well
mrs parrot is it necessary for me to give evidence as well
no it’s not necessary if the evidence of pralene botha is
sufficient there is no need for us to take your evidence if it doesn’t
add anything new so we will not swear you in but we appreciate that you
are you here to sit next to your sisterinlaw and to support here as she
gives her evidence before the commission we’ll now ask you pralene to
stand up to take the oath and reverend xundu will administer that
thank you reverend xundu we will ask mrs crichton to put a few
questions to you based on your statement
thank you mr chairperson good afternoon pralene
you are here this afternoon to tell us about your husband
george and his death on the fifteenth of december in but before you
start could you tell us a little bit about george about his character
what kind of a person he was before we actually start
george was a school teacher and he related very well to his
pupils and to the people and persons around him he was loved very much by
his family his mother his sisters and the rest of his extended family
as well as by us his friends and his pupils still speak of him to this
day they still tell us that they miss him and that they can actually
think how he would have reacted especially to the occurrences of our
at that time in there were student uprisings around
the country what was the situation in the area where you come from in
at the time he was teaching at patterson high school and even
those pupils during those last six months had occasions where they also
had clashes with the police or where they also came into uprising with
the situation at the schools and in the country and george himself was
very much involved with the pupils he was actually the person who stood
behind them when persons perhaps some of his colleagues or other adults
were a bit more conservative in their approach to the situation george
would actually be with the pupils and understand their position and not
condemn them for the stance they took
thank you for filling us in on that bit of background can
you now proceed with the story of exactly what happened as you understand
george was detained from his school his place of work on the
tenth of december at about noon that day he was detained with another
colleague of his miss amelia gervel but she was released later that same
day george was detained and taken to a police station and from there he
was taken to the sanlam building in strand street he was held there and
at various police stations or police cells without us actually having any
access to him on the friday when he was detain i tried to find out where
he was held but nobody was available to inform me of his whereabouts and
of course the reason why he was detained
when he was actually arrested who came to arrest him at
to my knowledge it was two or three security policemen but who
they actually were i don’t know i did hear that it could have been a
colonel snyman but i’m not sure at this stage any longer
can you now continue and tell us what happened on the
wednesday when colonel snyman came to see you
you mean the wednesday of his death at that time i was
working at one of the banks at port elizabeth and i was supposed to have
phoned them at ten o’clock that morning and they would have told me if i
was allowed to see george during the course of that day just before ten
o’clock before i could actually phone them to ask whether i could see
george because i wanted him to have clean clothing and toiletries etc
they came to my place of work to the bank and they informed me that he
previous to this you’ve just said that he was moved from
one place to another how did you know that was that what they were
afterwards we learnt that he had been held at the despatch
police stations overnight but he was brought to the sanlam building in
strand street for questioning during the course of the day
and what did they tell you the cause of death was
they said that he had flung himself down the stairwell from
the sixth floor of the sanlam building
yes an inquest was held about may the following year may
can you tell us something of what happened at those
the memory is a big vague because at that stage it seemed such
a lost cause in any case but i do remember that policemen i can’t even
be sure but people were called to the stand and they gave their
testimonies but i can’t recall who they really were but they outcome of
the inquest was that nobody was held responsible for george’s death
although he died he went down the stairwell and he was accused of having
done it himself of having killed himself they say that nobody was held
one of the reasons why i asked you to give a character
reference if you want to call it a reference at the beginning was so
that we would know a little bit of what his personality was like do you
no i never believed it and nobody else has actually ever
george was held in detention for five days he was questioned
he was most probably tortured and perhaps during one of the torture
sessions they went a bit too far and perhaps he died at that point or
perhaps he was mutilated at that stage that it would have been better or
they felt it was better to just finish off the deed
are you aware that there is a document that comes out of
unesco entitled commission on human rights from the thirty fifth session
of the agenda item do you know about this document
in the document there is medical evidence given not only
by the state pathologists but also by a doctor cooper have you heard
i know that at the postmortem there were a number of doctors
present even our family doctor doctor lionel smith at that stage was
asked to be present and i know the state pathologist was also present but
i’m sorry i can’t recall their names at this stage
because in this document it is actually stating that there
were wounds on the body which were inflicted some hours before the death
of your husband and this document will be handed in the trc so that they
can use it in their investigations obviously this has had an effect on
you and your family could you tell us pralene how has affected your
my two sons garth and lyle were very small when he died garth
was four and lyle was two but they had to grow up with the knowledge that
their father just wasn’t there and when they were big enough they
realised how he was accused of having died this happened twenty and a
half years ago or lets say fifteen years ago and the climate was still
such that his death did perhaps leave a bit of a slur on his name people
perhaps because of the situation the country was in people did perhaps i
don’t know what they felt but people most probably weren’t as shocked by
his death some people might even have thought he had it coming because
george was a person who was very outspoken about his beliefs and he
really was prepared to fight and to sacrifice for liberty and perhaps
people felt that this is what actually happened to him
in coming to the truth commission what are your
expectations as to how we will help you
i would really like just to know what really happened that
fateful day or that fateful period because over the years many of us
myself in particular and his family his sister next to me here and his
mother have agonised about how he must have suffered at the hands of the
police at that stage and just to know for sure because we’ve always
thought about the worst things which could have happened to him but just
to be sure what really transpired at that point and of course how he
actually died if it wasn’t suicide then we would want to have his name
cleared because george wasn’t a person according to us who would have
taken his life he actually prepared himself to be part of our liberation
when it eventually came because he could never see that we would be in
bondage for the rest of our lives he saw himself as being part of our
liberation part of the democratic process that we are going through at
thank you so you are basically saying you’re looking for
the truth how would you fell and this is my last question to you if the
perpetrators applied for amnesty and received it
i would accept it because i feel that people wouldn’t really
come out with the truth if they really have the fear that they would be
prosecuted that is just human nature and if they can at this stage feel
that to put our hearts at rest they’ll come out with the truth and then
perhaps get away with it i wouldn’t be very happy about it but i would
accept it as just part of the process we are in
pralene do you feel that you have completed your testimony
to us is there anything that you might want to say or your sister wants
to whisper in your ear that you’ve forgotten
no i think i’ve said enough but if she want to add something
we will need to swear her in if she does want to add
something would you like us to swear you in
mrs parrot i will say something
can you swear her in what is your full name
roseline parrot would you kindly stand please
thank you you may take your seat
thank you mr chairperson right would you like to tell us
what it is you feel you would like to add to that
pralene did say everything that must be said but all i want
to tell the truth commission is that we as a family would really just
want to know what happened to george as it’s still hard for my mother at
the moment she’s very sick and she’s staying with me because she is so
sick and sometimes i can hear in her voice that she’s still talking about
him and wanted to know but she said that the people must get amnesty as
there must be reconciliation because george was the type of person 
when my father passed away he was like a father to us and he was like a
husband to my mother and i would like to add that he wasn’t the type of
person that would take his own life because he was looking forward to the
future he was the type of person that wanted to build a nation a good
nation that’s all i want to say
please convey our greetings to your mother and especially
for her sentiments about reconciliation we appreciate it and receive it
thank you very much i’ll hand you back to the chairperson now
pralene and roseline we thank you for sharing with us a
painful experience which has stayed with you since the death of you
husband for sharing the agony that you go through as you ask yourself
what exactly happened and i want to say there are a number of people in
this country who have experienced this occurrence of people who are said
to have thrown themselves out of the windows of interrogation chambers
and the question that lingers in their minds is did they really throw
themselves was the situation that they were experiencing in the detention
cells or in the torture chambers was it so unbearable what exactly was
happening that was so unbearable that they felt that they should throw
themselves out of the windows or is the truth perhaps that they got
killed and then were thrown out or were they thrown out in order to be
killed those are the questions which continue to remain unresolved in
the minds of the people who have gone through this experience and now i
want to say that there are a few of them a few incidents of people who
have just been reported to have thrown themselves out of detention out
of the windows of interrogation chambers
	we share the agony with you and we share the call that you have made for
the truth to be told by those people who are responsible for this those
who were responsible for detaining george and those who were responsible
for looking after him during the period that he was detained and we share
your call in pleading with them to tell us the truth so that we know
	we thank you for your story and more than thanking you for your story we
thank you for the manner in which you shared your story i’ve not sensed
any bitterness i’ve not sensed any anger any call for vengeance you’ve
told your story with dignity and with grace indeed the dignity that
belongs to a person like george who gave his life for the liberation of
our land we convey to you our respect we convey to your mother our
respect and we just want you to know that today we salute george and we
appreciate the fact that in the socalled coloured community there are
people who even at that stage took the position that something wrong was
happening in this land and it is to be corrected even if it cost them
their lives thank you very much
i greet you this afternoon mr chairperson i request to swear
michael thembakazi tuku and themba faku
can i lead them in evidence nomazizi gangala we welcome you
this afternoon to the commission could you briefly tell us your story in
order for us to have a clear picture regarding the incident you are here
in i’m not sure if it was november but it was after
the school’s final exams my child said that he’s going to highway
because he’d seen a job vacancy at the ok i told him not to go to
highway because there was unrest at the time due to the bus boycott he
went to a public phone next to pick and pay and he tried to phone but
they beat him up killed him and put him in a van i was told that my
child had been beaten up by the police i bought bread and milk and left
they did not kill him but they arrested him and took him to prison when
i got home i got a message that my child had been murdered in prison by
other prisoners according to the witnesses who saw him said that he had
been beaten up at the phone at pick and pay and thrown into a police van
so he was actually murdered at the phone at pick and pay
was he a member of any organisation
no he was not a member of any organisation it was the
father who was a member of a political organisation
therefore they just beat him up the didn’t have anything
against him in a political sense
no they said that they found him killed by other prisoners
did you go to any attorneys
did you get a death certificate
no i did not i even tried now but they said i must go to
the police station where i was told to go to west bank
do you have requests before the commission
i would just like to know who the perpetrators are because i
have an idea they were seen by witnesses but i want to make sure because
these people were sent by the government they were under the government
of the day who were beating people
is that all ma’am or is there something you would like to add
thank you perhaps my colleagues have questions
michael ndaliso michael ndaliso will you please briefly tell
us how your boy was murdered
it was in around the fourth of august when i was
sleeping at home and my daughter nazi ndaliso together with her brother
was preparing to go here in east london it was at about half past five
in the morning when my son came to tell me that he could not find his
sister and people were being shot i tried to go to the place where my
daughter worked and i was crossing the road to king william’s town i
	when i got to djidini i looked for my daughter but could not find her i
went to fort jackson jail at about six thirty but my child was not there
so i ran to makiwane hospital where there were people’s corpses thrown
about a metre high on top of each other i looked but my child was not
there so i went to the mortuary and could not find my child
	on the saturday in the late afternoon i came back home i told my wife
that i cannot find the child on sunday morning as i was walking i heard
shooting yet again and tried to hide but the shooting died down i was
going to cambridge police station when i got there at a quarter to eight
in the morning i had been walking since two am the mortuary was not
open the sergeant asked what was going on and i told him but he said i
must wait for the mortuary to be opened a white man came and went to
open the mortuary for me there were a lot of corpses there some people
had lost their legs some had no ribs and they were just thrown on the
floor 	eventually i saw a head she’d been shot and i told the white man
that it was my child they pulled the tray and it was her indeed
where was your child shot and how when did she get shot
they asked if i wanted to take the corpse then
what i’d like to know is when was your child shot and where
had she been shot on the saturday or the friday
i found my child at cambridge on sunday she’d been shot at
djidili and taken over to cambridge
are there any people who informed what happened or do you have

we have three sandile is the eldest and there are two that
did you get a death certificate stating how your child died
did you lay charges or did you investigate the matter
yes it was the legal representative here in highway mike
mike rabe did not take this case to the end because he left
mdantsane and i went to another attorney lale in town
as i am paying for my children’s education and i’m supporting
them as a pensioner and the schools require money daily my request to
the government is that i want my children to be educated

to proceed with his studies and my daughter is going to standard eight
so you would the government to assist you with your children’s

thank you sir perhaps my copanelists will ask you questions
themba please tell us briefly about sisa’s death was he your
please tell us briefly what happened on that day
it was on a saturday on the sixth i was coming from work at
about ten and when i got home i was told that he was shot during the day
the information i got from the people was that all the boys were playing
with a tennis ball between the shop and the rent office and the soldiers
and the police came with their van we were not sure about the ciskeians
whether they were soldiers or police as the children were still very
young they were not aware of the situation they didn’t know what was
happening so they ran away and while they were still running one
policeman approached him and shot him in the mouth
was there a court case after this shooting incident or did you
go to any attorneys we do understand your pain mr faku and i trust you
are now ready for us to continue was there a court case or did you go to
i went to mr insasiwisa a lawyer who accepted my case and said
that what he can claim will be at the bureau’s expenses because he said
that we could not get anything from the ciskeian government there was an
inquest and the perpetrator was in court but no one was found guilty
is the perpetrator the one you mentioned here
yes his name is kepo but i don’t know his first name
yes i saw him a few months ago he’s still a policeman
our investigators can go to him and investigate so that he can
yes because he’s still here in the eastern cape he’s a
thank you sir do you have any requests for us to forward to
the state president concerning this matter
as my lawyer told me i should be compensated for the funeral
expenses and that didn’t happen what i would like from the government is
for this to happened because i did not kill anyone and i have to get
what else would you like us to forward to the state president
one other thing is that i would like kepo to come forward and
in your statement you mention a crèche can you please explain
maybe you would like a memorial where young children can be
yes i do remember now that i mentioned i would like a crèche to
thank you sir is that all
thank you mr chairperson i will now hand over to you
mrs gangala please mrs gangala can you hear me
i just need some clarification from you you said that the
father of this child diliza was involved in a political organisation but
that he was not is that correct
and he was eighteen years old so he was not a member of
no he was not a member
so the attack on him was a totally unjustified attack the
second thing i want to say to you is you mentioned that somebody or
they told you that other prisoners had killed him who were the they
the people who told me were my neighbours
do have any idea how they found that out
concerning his death how do you believe he died
he died because he was beaten up by the police
i want to check this point landile jongile is he here
thank you i would like to take this opportunity to thank the
nine witnesses who appeared before the commission today the three who
are on stage and the six who gave evidence this morning when i thank you
i would like to say the incident in which people were shot here in
mdantsane at the station shocked the whole country i think this also
shocked other countries besides this country this is one of the
incidents which showed clearly that the previous homeland governments
were cruel especially the government of the late ll sebe i think this
is one of the incidents which caused tension and conflict between people
of this area and people belonging to sinip and those who were working for
mr ll sebe’s government that conflict and that anger and pain became
clear in when the late ll sebe was overthrown when there was chaos
in mdantsane there was in this area people were angry and their anger
came from this incident but i would like to say like all other painful
incidents such as this one this caused people to fight for their rights
to belong to the south african government the whole border region and
mdantsane was leading this region mdantsane was playing a leadership
role in this region from this incident and this became clear in when
the late ll sebe was overthrown 	the other incident which happened was
the bisho massacre some of you were injured yourselves and some appeared
before the commission to give us their evidence some lost their family
members some didn’t even want to appear before the commission because
they are still angry at what happened at eggerton railway station we
would like to thank you for reminding this country end of tape 
after this country has been liberated so that when we are enjoying the
fruits of freedom especially those who are leaders they have to remember
that mdantsane played a leading role in our struggle
	we have listened carefully to your requests if it was upon us we would
try and answer your requests now because we are talking of the heroes who
sacrificed their lives to try and liberate this country but our job is to
listen and after listening to you when we give the report to the
president next year we will present your requests to the president so
that he can see what he can do
	we would like to salute the people from mdantsane especially those who
lost their family members in this incident where we were in the morning
that’s where the heroes are we thank you very much you may now go back
david gobizembe please stand up sir please take off your cap
mr gobizembe can you hear me
before you start on your story there are a few questions i
need to ask you just so that i’m very clear before i listen to your
story the first question that i want to ask you you say that you were
in a military camp in zimbabwe for political reasons i want you to just
to explain that to me please what do you mean by this
yes i was there i went to zimbabwe in from quatro in
angola i ran to zimbabwe because i was illtreated i was treated as a
prisoner but i was in a struggle and i think i was wasting my time
alright thank you that was the first question when you
were in zimbabwe and you got to zimbabwe you were at a military camp
which one was that which camp was it
i was in queens park in zimbabwe
i need to ask you a few questions if you’ll please just bear
with me who was the commander at that camp
yes that’s right if you can’t remember that’s all right
you also say in your statement that it was during the mutiny period but
as far as i understand there wasn’t any mutiny in zimbabwe there was in
angola is it the mutiny in angola that you’re talking about
that’s fine that helps me to understand much better you say
that you went to the oau in zambia is that right and it was there that
you were stabbed and shot is that correct
now i can let you tell your story because i’m now clear
thank you please carry on and tell us what happened
i was with my friends when we saw our friends running and
we discovered that there was shooting joseph sotetsi who was my best
friend was sitting next to me but he ran away and jumped a fence
i’m sorry that we’re going to interrupt you mr gobizembe and
ask you if you would start from when you were in south africa and from
there move through with your story
i left this country in and went into exile when i got
to angola i was not trusted like others and was not treated well i
didn’t stay comfortably from the day that i arrived there i said that i
came to join the anc but they didn’t trust me and regarded me as a state
agent and took me to rc camp quatro in angola where they put me in the
cells underground there were other people there who were also referred
to as state agents but those people are the same people serving the
present government we were not state agents but they assaulted and beat
us sotetsi was shot and fell in my arms as i was trying to hold him i
was shot in my side and when i tried to look behind i just fell down as
there was somebody who was beating me with a bush knife whilst i was shot
	i was then taken to hospital and i decided not to go back there because
what i came to do i did not do what i’m trying to say is that i’m sorry
for joining the anc because i’m crippled i had an operation in my hand
but my muscles were injured and i cannot do anything now this was
because i was accused of this i would still like the anc to tell me
whether i was a state agent or whether i’m still a state agent i was
around this area i was not staying in one place i was harassed by the
boers and the anc i would go to port elizabeth asking for help as i
didn’t have a place to stay because the boers and the anc was harassing
me i moved around the world but today i’m confused because i don’t
think even our present government has a future
please keep quiet people thank you
mr gobizembe thank you for telling us your story we have
got the facts now that is why i asked so many questions and we will
investigate and do what we can i’m going to hand you back to the
mr gobizembe we will thank you together with other people
you may step down for now
we welcome you naledi we’re going to request that reverend
thank you mr chairperson is the lady next to you going to
thank you can i swear them in
we’re going to hand over to tiny maya to lead you in evidence
thank you mr chairperson we greet you mrs nkula i’m going to
start with you because your evidence is documented before us you’re
going to talk about thembelihle arnold gush who was shot and died on the
eleventh of february in at vulindlele police station is that
please tell us more about thembelihle who was he how was he
thembelihle was my brother i was born after him it was
on a sunday the eleventh when mr mandela was released he left home to go
to church because he was in the choir and my parents were going to
follow he said that if he comes back late from the church it will be
because he’s joined the marches when my parents got to church they did
not see him but they were not concerned because he’d said he’d join the
marches if they were there they came back from church my parents stay
at nu and i stay at nu i was going to watch our president’s release
on tv just before i started watching the programme my mother phoned me
saying that our grandfather phoned and said that he’d heard that
thembelihle had been shot my husband was there and he went to hospital
he said he was going to see him at the hospital i was with a friend so i
stayed behind i thought he’d come back and tell us what happened an
hour later i got a telephone call from thembisa who stays at nu asking
if i’m lithle’s sister and i said yes he said he’s from makiwane
hospital and he’d taken my brother to the hospital he’d been shot next
to our house he was taken into a van which took him to makiwane
hospital when he phoned me he said that they’d left him at makiwane
hospital i was with my friend and my little child and i got a bit
impatient we went straight to the hospital there were a whole lot of
soldiers and it was difficult to get in but eventually we did we went
in they said they don’t know anything about my brother and we asked if
we could peruse the admission register but apparently it had been said
that nobody could look at the admissions register we asked around but
apparently nobody had seen him one of the nurses said that we must go to
frere hospital to check there but nobody knew anything about my brother
	eventually i saw an admissions clerk who knew me and knew my brother as
well he said that he saw people going in but he didn’t see my brother
that was at about seven o’clock i went back to the makiwane hospital and
i asked for an admissions register but there was none i went home back
home just to switch on the lights and lock just after i got home i got
another call and they said i must go home because they’d found my
brother my husband and i missed each other on the way there was a
rumour at makiwane hospital that nobody was allowed to go in because
there were apparently corpses there and noone should see them this is
what my husband was told one of the nurses said to him that he’d seen
some of the corpses but he hadn’t seen my brother my husband wasn’t
given any admissions register either he went to a nurse that he saw who
had the keys to this room when he got there there were about four or
five other corpses and he identified my brother he then went home and
	that was the eleventh of february on the sunday and on the twelfth we
went to makiwane hospital strangely enough makiwane hospital knew
nothing about these corpses we went to the police station at unit and
they knew nothing about this either my husband reiterated that he saw
my brother’s corpse somebody said we must go to west bank because the
corpses that were at makiwane hospital were transferred to west bank as
we arrived at west bank a police van arrived as well there was a
pathologist who worked there where the police were he showed us the
corpse and we identified my brother he had a hole on his forehead as
well as at the back of his head apparently the bullet went into the back
of his head and came out of his forehead there was a paper on his thumb
with unknown written on it that was on the monday
	a policeman mamo the mdantsane knows him he came to my house and said
that he’d heard that my brother had been shot and he advised us to go and
lay charges before the sun set on the very same day the police came we
were called to the police station at nu i went there with my
parents the late mr zebe was sent from bisho and he was there to open a
docket we were puzzled because we had not yet gone to the police but
bisho already knew that there was this man who had been shot and a docket
about this case should be opened they asked us what had happened and we
told them that we did not know a lot of people came to us from the
celebration and told us that people were marching from nu a white
opel that i had seen driven by the police that day stopped and started
shooting around the stadium and then this car went towards the police
station this car was driving around the crowds they stopped and opened
the doors and starting shooting this is when my brother got shot around
the police station the policemen in the car were named should i name
the two policemen’s names were sitile gole and madikane
whose first name i don’t know these were the names that is how my
brother passed away he’d been wearing a suit and he had a bible and a
hymn book because he was going to church he’d changed at my uncle’s
place therefore we got these back we could not bury him the next
weekend because we had to wait for my mother’s sisters from zimbabwe and
	on the monday of the year he died he was doing his third year at
gobusane he worked for ten years at the mbsa and he’d gone back to
school it was his last year at gobusane the gobusane students came to
us on monday the twelfth this white kadett was there people pointed out
and identified the car this car had no window at the back i think it
was cb or ca i don’t remember well the school children dispersed and
that was that however from the twelfth to the twenty fourth when we
buried my brother the streets behind us and just ahead of us was full of
	on the twenty third as we were going to bury my brother on the twenty
fourth we were called to the police station at unit we went there and
spoke to some man i can’t remember his name i think it was the station
commander but it was the highest man in status there he asked where we
were going to bury my brother and we said we were going to use the church
at nu and they said we could not use the church at nu because
people are going to be incited we had to use a stadium or a church from
nu and then use the nearest graveyard
could we assist each other here did you bury peacefully
the police vans and cars were around all the time on the
friday as we were going to bury on the saturday we were called to the
police station and they said we should not have a night vigil in the
evening on friday because there were going to be problems we said that
if the people wanted a night vigil we had to and the station commander
said he’s warning us and we should not complain if something happens
there was a night vigil but it was disrupted they took down people’s
names and we were told to stop the night vigil within an hour
did you lay charges as you seem to be aware of who the
no there was no court case i cannot remember whether
three or four months had elapsed after the funeral and we were called
because there was going to be an inquest we went there and after a
minute they asked if the gush family was there and we said yes the
magistrate said the inquest concerning your son nobody can be held
therefore the inquest proceedings were not in your presence
you were just informed of the conclusions
yes i did not know what was happening as i thought we
would be part of the investigation because we had information as well
this magistrate went back to his chambers and i thought we should
approach him i approached him asking him who he was and he said he’s mr
matwana we asked him if this was the normal procedure for an inquest and
he said he didn’t know but he’d been sent to give this conclusion we
asked him from where and he said he could not divulge that information
was this magistrate from the area or from another area
i have no clue but because i was dealing with him at the
time i had to ask his name i don’t know whether he works in the area
had you seen him prior to that
did you got to an attorney
no but we have a friend who is an attorney and we asked
him what the legal proceedings would be how would we deal with this and
he said that if members of the government civil service were perpetrators
it would be difficult to deal with the case we asked the white man in
west bank what the corpse was doing there and he said that it was there
for a postmortem and we said that as a family we didn’t ask for a
do you know who this doctor is
i don’t know but we got results from the postmortem
they said that the cause of death was a bullet that entered from the
your brother was thirty one years old did he have a wife and
he’d had a wife but they were separated he has one son
who was nine years old in and the other one was born in after
they stay with my mother the eldest 
we’ll ask for the details later does naledi’s mother have
i just want to take over the eldest child was terribly
affected by this incident he was very close to his father and his
lifestyle deteriorated he is in a reformatory in cape town
he turned sixteen on the second of march he’d say that if his
father was alive things would be different at home another calamity that
befell our home is that my husband’s health deteriorated terribly after
my son’s death he was a teacher and that was his last year the students
were requesting that he resigns because he was not of good health on the
monday the twelfth of february there were celebrations at thabakandota
there was a voice on the radio that day and this voice was saying that
gush was not at the celebration even though i was doing everything for
him feeding him and supporting him he was biting the very hand that was
providing for him he gave a command that the ciskeian police in
mdantsane must shoot those people that do not appreciate what he had done
for him he was heartbroken his will to live was no longer there in
thank you ma’am do you have requests that we can present to
two requests that are strong in my heart i am not bitter i do
not want revenge but my eyes long to see the man who killed my eldest
	secondly he has children the eldest being in a reformatory has no
direction at all i am his father and i am his mother if i die tomorrow
this child will have no parents he must be able to stand for himself in
life how is he going to be able to do that without parents even the
younger one is disabled and has been for the last four years i support
that child and i’m helped by my daughters who are married i want my
grandchildren to stand as dignified men in society

that particular day there were police placed in three police stations
there were police in nu nu and in nu i was stationed at nu 
then the area in which we patrolled was from nu to nu the police
from nu were working in their area and the police from nu were
working in their area at that time i was in highway together with
inspector balt who was the driver and i was the passenger we were
patrolling our area and we could hear everything that was happening in nu
 over the radio i never went to nu because i was patrolling my
area when i got to nu i found a white monza with a broken window next
to the police station in nu after this i heard that people said that
i killed thembelihle gush and i don’t know him i told mr sewisa about
this and he asked me why i’m not challenging this and i said i reported
the matter to my office and i was willing to challenge these allegations
but the person who was in authority in my office said that i must drop
this i saw mr sewisa in the stadium and i told him that i am called to
appear before the commission because i am accused of killing thembelihle
i never saw him and i didn’t even know him that is all
thank you very much mr madikane we are just going to ask you
client a few questions for him to clarify things which are not clear to
us at this stage mr van heerden as i said to you earlier we are not
contemplating making a finding at this stage if at any time we are
contemplating making a finding which will define mr madikane as a
perpetrator we will serve a notice on him and we will inform him that we
are contemplating making a finding but just for the clarity of the
commission we will raise a few questions on what he has said to us let
me speak in xhosa referring to you mr madikane
	you said in your statement that there were different police stations and
you were patrolling different areas on that particular day where were
we were not patrolling from any way but the police were to
report according to their stations i went to nu to report to my police
station police from nu went to report to nu 
what was the reason for this
the reason was that there was going to be a march on that
where did this march come from
i don’t know i won’t lie i don’t know because i just heard
there was going to be a march on that particular day and we had to report
to our different stations i won’t lie saying that the people who marched
in your statement you said that everything that was happening
at nu you could hear over the radio but you don’t know what was
what i’m saying is that as the police we could hear the
police from nu because we were in the car at that time
we heard that there were people in nu ’s police station
we heard that from the radio while patrolling our area in nu 
please give us in detail the report you got over the radio
telling you what was happening in nu 
please tell us clearly and in detail what you could hear from
the radio what was happening in nu because you said that everything
that was happening in nu you could hear it over the radio
we heard that people were lowering the flag in nu 
they said that people were lowering the flag in nu 
is that all what else did you hear over the radio
yes we heard that people were in nu and they were going
to lower the flag that is all i heard
did you hear that people were shot
no i did not hear that i’m not going to lie
according to your knowledge were there any people who were
the only person i heard of that was shot in nu was
thembelihle the one referred to earlier i heard that he was shot by me
where did you hear that thembelihle gush was shot in nu 
i heard this from the township that there was a person by
the name of thembelihle who was shot by myself this i heard after a week
and i didn’t even know him
this unit nu were you working in that unit
no i was working in nu the police station from nu the
police working in nu were those reporting to that police station i
when you heard this allegation that you shot thembelihle gush
in nu did you try to investigate this matter did you try to find out
details from the police of nu about this did you go to the police
from nu to find out what exactly happened
no i was not interested in investigating that because i
knew that the police from nu were in nu i was not interested
because i knew that i was not there you can go in nu and you will see
the police who were there on that day
you were not interested in knowing exactly what happened in nu
no i’m not going to lie i was not interested because i was
not there i was not interested in knowing the details
thank you mr chairperson mr madikane i have a few questions
for you there’s a person by the name of sitile gola and both of you are
alleged to have shot thembelihle do you know mr gola
were you together on this particular day or did you spend any
no on that day i was only working with bult i didn’t work
with mr gola on that particular day
after you hear of the shooting incident you didn’t meet with
mr gola whether it was in the police station or in the car
no i’m not going to lie i did not meet him but when we got
to nu i saw a car with broken windows
there is a car referred to by mrs gush which was patrolling in
the township do you know anything about this car
no i only know the car i was in
do you know the make of the car
it was an opel monza there were two opel monzas in nu 
and one from nu there were three opel monzas in mdantsane at the time
we were using an opel monza with inspector bult and i think there were
do you know whether gola was using a car
i don’t know i never saw him that day
when you were given instructions on this day what were the
we were told to patrol the area so that people cannot
in other words you were only patrolling
yes we were only patrolling we were not instructed to go
and disrupt the people who were marching but we were just patrolling
the last question were you armed
yes as detectives we have pistols with us all the time i
think the people from the police from other areas were also armed
do you have any knowledge of the number of police who were
in your area how many were you
i cannot count there were many of us
mr madikane i want to ask you two questions the first one
just a short answer were you able to speak to people in police cars in
were you able to converse or speak to people who were in
police cars in other areas you could hear what was going on in nu but
could you actually contact them on your radio
on that day there were cars all around and in fort jackson
there were many people in nu the cars were only watching these people
they could not even go into nu we could hear people from the cars not
and on occasion like this when there’s trouble in an area
do they not call in cars to come from other areas to assist
i said that there were police from nu and nu we were
in nu patrolling our area we did not know that there was a problem but
we knew that there were people who were lowering the flag and there were
police to sort out that problem in that area
so i just want to clarify that you were not called in over
your radio to come and assist at all
thank you mr chairman mr madikane let me start this way do
you know the work of the commission and very briefly can you please tell
us what the duty of the commission is
no i don’t know the duty or the work of the commission
very briefly mr madikane our work as the commission is to
assist in the process of reconciliation so that if there is a way what
happened in the past people would forget and forgive that is our duty
it is not our duty at all to try and find excuses to say that the people
were supposed to do this and not that our work is to get the truth from
the people to open their hearts i’m just telling you briefly about our
i’m listening to you sir if i was there i would tell you
that i was there i’m telling you exactly what happened because i was
never in that area the person who was with me can come here and tell you
unfortunately we don’t have time i wanted to ask you questions
so that we can get clarity about the incident but i will only ask you two
or three questions as a person who is accused of being involved in this
incident did you take any steps to try and show that these are only
yes i wanted to take steps as i’ve already said before i
went to the person who was in authority saying that i want to challenge
this but he stopped me i went to mr sewisa and told him the same thing
he asked why i don’t challenge it and i told him that i wanted to
challenge this matter but they stopped me in the office
how did you plan to challenge this
i planned to challenge it because i was accused of killing a
did you go to gush’s family to tell them that you have no idea
yes i wanted to clear my name but the person in authority
said that i must stop this
who was in authority at the time
i think it was a mr songusho
how long did you work in the police force at that time in the
i don’t remember but now i’m in the police force for fifteen
at the time of the bus boycott were you a policeman
i was in college in hamanskraal at the time i was not here
thank you mr madikane as i’ve already said we don’t have time
but i would have liked to ask you more questions so that we can get some
mr madikane the last question how do you feel about what
this was painful mr chairperson it is very painful because
they lost their son but it is very painful on my side coming before the
people here and being accused of something i wasn’t even involved in i’m
staying in golden highway and a person came from tjolo and wanted to know
where i was staying at the time he was speaking about this accusation
he was sitting next to me and i think it was three to four years back he
did not know me but he was speaking about my and one guy vuyani was
sitting next to me and he said that i had nothing to do with this this
guy was only talking he did not even know me it is very painful to me
because people in mdantsane are saying these things i was in a course in
bisho the week before last when there was a shooting and i heard from
bisho that i arrested these people but i was in bisho i was not here in
mdantsane even today i came from the course in bisho i was accused of
arresting these people but i was not there what i’m trying to say is
that this is not the first time that i am accused
so in other words you would be able to help us to answer this
question from gush’s family that they want to know who killed their son
will you be able to help us
i can’t say mr chairperson because what was happening there
it is clear that they were the police who shot them up until today i
don’t have any information about that incident the person who shot him
is quiet he’s not saying anything the people said that the police were
shooting at them i can’t say that i will be able to help you
thank you mr chairperson mr madikane if i’m listening to you
clearly in your testimony especially in your last part of your testimony
you are an unfortunate person because you are always accused of things
what is the reason for this
the reason for that is that i work very hard and i do my job
did i hear you clearly in conclusion when you said that you are
an inspector but this commission which is doing an important duty and
which is well known in the whole country and in the whole world you as
an inspector you don’t know the duties of the commission
i don’t know why i’m here sir and i also said i don’t know
the duties or the work of the commission
thank you thank you mr chairperson
mr madikane we thank you very much for appearing before the
commission to try and help us to find out the truth i think that your
presence here at the commission is a contribution and i hope that you
will continue helping us so that we can find an answer for the gush
family so that they may be satisfied we hope that your position as a
policeman who was present on that particular day although you were not in
nu can help us to answer this question we will ask you to help us and
to bear with us if we come back to you asking for more information
you’ve already said that it is very painful for you to be accused of
something you never did if it is possible for us as the commission to
find out the truth and report this to the family you will be accepted
back in mdantsane community because we have found out the truth if you
can help us to find out the truth i think that the family will be free
and you as well because i don’t think that this stigma about you can be
removed if we don’t find an answer to their question and to the people
who were affected by this incident please bear with us if we come back
to you as the commission maybe our investigators may come back to you to
ask you certain questions in order to find out the truth we’d like to
thank you very much for now and thank you mr van heerden as i said
earlier we are not contemplating making a finding at this stage the
matter is going to be a subject of
ongoing investigation by our investigation unit
thank you mr chairman may i stand up
mr ss gola please come forward together mr mbandazayo mr
mbandazayo i would like to confirm your name and the name of your client
and why you are appearing before the commission today
thank you mr chairman i confirm that my name is lugani
mbandazayo and i represent mr gola sitile simon gola thank you
mr gola what is your full name
before we hand over to mr mbandazayo so that he can lead you
please stand so that we can swear you in reverend xundu will swear you
thank you mr gola we’ll hand over to mr mbandazayo to lead mr
mr chairman as you are aware you have a summary of the
evidence in front of you which is going to be presented by my client at
this stage i will try and lead him on the points which have been raised
in that statement mr gola you were here when the complainant was giving
evidence before the commission can you in your own words tell the
commission what happened on the day in question
first of all i would like to thank this commission for having
come to mdantsane so that we are able to talk about this accusation on
the said day i was on duty i was driving in a ford sierra gce when
i heard a report on the radio that the people were trying to lower a flag
at nu police station and all the police cars should go there as i was
alone in the car i drove and got to nu where there were a whole lot of
people but nothing was happening at that time i was driving behind a
police van this van parked on one side at the nu police station and i
	just after i had switched the car off i heard a bang on the car’s window
behind me when i looked there were a whole lot of stones being thrown at
car and the back window was broken i thought it best not to get out of
the car as i might be attacked because they were throwing stones however
i did get out of the car and rolled into the police station shots were
fired from the police at nu and the people dispersed as my car was
damaged i asked the man in authority of the whole operation to summons a
finger print expert to come photographs were taken and i opened a case
i don’t know anything about this man being shot thank you
thank you mr sitile gola mr mbandazayo may we ask a few
thank you mr chairman mr gola i’m going to ask you a few short
questions did you every find out who shot this man
no truly but inspector madikane’s name and mine were
was it on the radio in the newspapers or was it people
just the people around and we don’t know who but we heard that
have you ever shot anyone as a policeman
you don’t have a record of having shot anyone perhaps by
did you carry a gun as a policeman
yes even now and previously as well
on the day that you ran for cover did you shoot
i couldn’t shoot the people because it was a crown and there
were too many stones coming my way
thank you mr chairperson mr gola just a few questions were
no i was stationed in bisho
did you come from bisho on this day or when did you leave
on that day i was instructed to work in mdantsane to keep order
when were these instructions given where they given on that
that order must be kept in the entire mdantsane
what would you have done if there were damages
we’d have to report to the authorities
you said you’d heard on radio that the police must go and help
with the crowd at nu what kind of help were you instructed to give
to protect the police station premises and the police
how would you protect yourselves what were you going to do
it would have depended on the situation
when you rushed to nu what were your intentions
to protect the police and police premises
i’ve not yet got an answer that i would like when you stopped
the car and stones were thrown at you how far were you from the nu 
i said that as i parked the car there was a bang and when i
looked my car was being stoned two of the stones smashed the window and
i crawled into the police station
where were the rest of the policemen could they see you or
if we could go to nu i would explain this if this is the
police station there were a whole lot of cars parked right next to the
did you see other policemen when you were parking
yes but because of the stones everybody tried to run for cover
did you know the policemen at nu 
yes i knew some of them some were from zwelitsha and others
did you see the police that were shooting and were there
yes as i said i looked around when i heard the bang and i ran
for cover when i realised that there were a lot of stones being thrown
so what you’re saying is the bullet sounds were from the
police at nu how did you know this
i said that shots were fired by the police
thank you mr gola even though you haven’t answered my question
mr gola please answer the question whoever is asking the
question does not matter please just answer it according to your
statement shots were fired by the police
i don’t know i just heard them shooting
after the shooting was anyone shot
i did not see anyone but my car as well as other police cars
you say that you got an instruction that you must go to nu 
was this to all the other policemen or just you
this instruction was to all the police that were patrolling
were you here when mr madikane gave evidence
yes and i cannot match with mine
thank you mr chairperson you say that you were sent to go
yes that was the instruction from the control office
what were you going to do to people that were marching there
i said that we would have to assess the situation and then
what were you supposed to do
we were not given any direct instruction
were you trained in a way that when people are causing unrest
in a particular manner you act in a specific manner yourselves
what were you supposed to do as police to control the crowds
any moment when you go to a place of chaos or unrest
well there are police trained specifically for that would that
answer you better i was just called to those premises to protect them
so what you’re saying is that the police that shot were taking
the law into their own hands as they had not been instructed to do so
were you armed with rubber bullets or real bullets
so you went there not trained to control a crowd and depending
on your pistol therefore if you are shocked you shoot
it would depend on the situation that i’d find myself in
thank you mr gola just one small thing what was your rank at
i was a sergeant i’m an inspector now
thank you for your evidence we are now more confused than we
i’m also confused having been put here and not having done
your evidence has left us more confused than we were before
when mr madikane gave evidence we thought that there was a bit of light
but your evidence is contradictory to his meaning that we are far from
the truth because this is conflicting and contradictory evidence there’s
one true and one false evidence and as the truth commission we have to
find a way to get the truth thank you for coming 	as i said to mr
madikane we are not contemplating making a finding at this stage but we
are going to continue with our investigation and when we contemplate
making a finding we will let you know i hope that you are going to help
the commission in investigating this matter and in reaching the truth
our country that we abide in stipulates that at least we live in truth
and the whole country is waiting for us to come forward with the truth
thank you mr gola thank you mr madikane mr mbandazayo thank you for
coming before us you are kindly excused
thank you mr chairperson mrs koloti i greet you how do you
thank you ma’am you are going to tell us about tamsanqa
walter koloti how were you related
according to the statement we have before us you apparently
got a report in that tamsanqa who was seventeen years at the time
was not well in tanzania what happened how did he get to tanzania and
i got a report that he was not well in december 
tamsanqa was a standard nine student at wangaletu he
disappeared on the tenth of july in after a while he wrote to us
telling us that he’s in maseru the special branch officers were looking
for him at our place quite frequently at the time we were told that if
somebody goes into exile they never come back
	 however in december my sister called me because he apparently had
a job to do here in south africa i saw him and then he left again he
said that he would come back soon what shocked me was that in december
 i got a letter from him himself telling me that he was not well and
that i must go to the anc offices to ask them to make it possible for me
to go and see him i got up early in the morning to go to mr metele and i
told him he was also shocked as he had not heard that my child was ill
and said he would investigate the matter i gave him a week and the
following week i went back to him he said that he found out that my son
was indeed not well i asked what was wrong with him and he said he was
ill from indigenous diseases in tanzania i asked if they could do
something so that i could go and see him but he said that the anc could
not afford it i didn’t know where to turn for help
	 my child wrote back but before that i wrote back to him and told him
what had happened he wrote yet again saying that i should go back to the
anc offices to request help which i did one morning at about nine
o’clock mr mettle came to my house and told me that my son was coming
back but he did not say when i was just happy that my he was coming back
but he never came back and i gave up
	in november i received his last letter reiterating the
deteriorating state of his health i was tired of the anc telling me that
they don’t have money inaudible were on robben island at the time
they were also young men from the neighbourhood i went to robben island
to ask them for a ticket and they already knew that tamsanqa was ill i
told them that i have this problem and they told me to go to frank
	even when i was in cape town i went to carl house and they tried to
phone around but they did not succeed it was the st of may that year on
a wednesday on the th of april at about eleven in the morning when mr
metele came to my house to asked if my son had come back and i said no
he said that it was a bit funny because the ill always come back home it
was in i had my child’s letters with me and i told him that the
entire year of i’d been going to the anc offices requesting help he
asked what his alias name was that he used in exile and i said that he
was samsomia he asked when last he wrote i said in november the
previous year i prepared for my child’s homecoming even though he was
	it was on a monday on the tuesday there were general anc meetings and i
would go to those i went to the meeting and then went back home because
there was no meeting after all my youngest child came to me saying that
mr metele is looking for me and together with my sister they were waiting
for me at home when i got home in the early evening there were women
from the community sad and bowed down but mr metele was not there i
looked around and i sensed in the atmosphere that my son had passed away
when my son told me that metele was around i thought that he had brought
my son back i went inside and asked is my child dead nobody answered
so i sat down after a short while mr metele came back as he’d gone to
look for me and he told me that my son had passed away i later found out
because my sister told me that there was a young man from tanzania who’d
gone to visit a friend at his punzani this young man remembered that
there was a comrade who he was in exile with and they got close because
they were all from east london but he would say that the house is in
mdantsane and the aunt lived in spunsani the other man said i know who
you are talking about and he said he was sure that the family didn’t know
that my son had passed away mr metele said that he would investigate the
matter and when he came on the monday asking if my son had arrived home
this was because he was making sure that my son did pass on mr metele
was not strong enough to tell me on his own so he went and got my sister
so that they could tell me together
	the anc then provided finances for me to go to tanzania to my son’s
grave when we got there i was asked why i did not go to tanzania whilst
my child was ill did mr stofili not go to my house because my child had
been calling for me while he was in hospital and mr stofili had promised
that he would go to my house and make preparations so that i could go and
visit my child in tanzania he stayed for weeks they did not bury my son
for two weeks because they were expecting me they apparently sent a fax
that i should be fetched to go to my son’s funeral and apparently the
people who received the fax in south africa replied saying that they’d
gone to sam’s mother that is myself and i’d been ill with a stroke and
i said they must bury my child that is how they buried him because
they’d received a false report that is how they went ahead with the
burial and they were shocked when they saw me i went in july telling
them that nobody said i must go to a funeral and that i never received
such a report i came back
	what shocks me is that our children were in a struggle for liberation
they fought people came back the ill came back before me but my child
was not brought back they watched him dying dying of what they know of
the poison they’d given him they did not give me the opportunity to look
after my child i could have taken him to doctors or to the hospital but
i was not given that opportunity and i do not know the reason when i
asked what my child was ill from i was referred from one person to
another and the final report was that my child was ill with aids that is
thank you mrs koloti your story is absolutely clear i will
hand you over to the chairperson but perhaps my colleagues will ask you
thank you mr chairperson mrs koloti who is leo mc donald
leo mc donald is a boy who was staying next to me he was my
neighbour when i went to tanzania he was there he was one of the
soldiers of the anc but now he is working in pretoria
he’s working in the anc offices in pretoria
siyabulela phezisa was with my son at school and in tanzania
i think he is working in bisho because when he came to visit me and we
were talking about this he said to me when tamsanqa was ill in tanzania
we were together he said to me he was the one who was supposed to come
back with him but during that period he was sent to another country to
attend a certain course he said he was surprised to hear that tamsanqa
died in tanzania because he was supposed to be returned back
i note that there are requests you mentioned when you gave
your statement firstly it is clear that you want full disclosure of the
cause of his death is that correct
in your statement you mentioned a request that you would like
medical treatment are there any reasons why you request medical
i’m not requesting medical treatment for myself
didn’t you make a request concerning your state of health
as our children left the country and their colleagues came
back we as the parents of those who did not come back due to different
reasons are affected because the children who came back are supporting
their families if my child was here in he promised to do certain
things for me and our home but unfortunately now he passed away and i
don’t know who is going to fulfill his promises to me i don’t know who
is going to support me as he was buried in that country and i’m a xhosa
person i would like his bones to be exhumed so that when i think of him i
will be able to go and visit his grave i also have two children who are
thank you mrs koloti thank you mr chairperson
before we let you go i have one question when you got to
tanzania you were told that they were sending messages to you that your
son was sick and they waited two weeks for you to come to attend his
funeral and a mr stofili was given a message to send to you
yes mr stofili got there while he was in hospital
what i would like to know is who was telling you these things
i don’t remember those people’s names but they were people
who were in charge of dakaula guest house dakaula where i was staying
they were people who were in dakaula guest house
were these people members of the anc
they were members of the anc but i don’t remember their names
you said that you don’t remember their names
no i don’t remember their names
did you know their names before or do you have any idea who
i will ask those young man who were there
thank you for your story mrs koloti and we will thank all of
you afterwards you may go back to your seat
we welcome you mr leleki we thank you for coming before the
commission i’ll hand over to nziki sandi who will lead you in evidence
thank you mr chairman mr leleki according to your statement
you are going to speak about your being attacked in east london being
accused of being an informer lets not go into detail about particular
incidents before you were attacked when you almost lost you life being
kicked and beaten with weapons who was attacking you
did you know him prior to this
i just knew him for a short while
please tell us how you got to know each other and how you met
i’d gone to look for a place to stay and as he was hoping
other comrades with accommodation so he’d just arrived from exile
you received training as an unkonto wezizwe soldier is that so
you came back and found out that jordan was helping with
before i got to know joe jordan i had a problem with
accommodation i could not stay at home because i’d just skipped bail our
home was full and there was a shebeen so i had to find accommodation
outside my home and my neighbour said comrade jordan was there to help so
i asked him to accompany me we did not find him the first day so we went
on another day and we were told that he had gone to a match on the third
day we got him and i introduced myself and he introduced himself he told
me that i’d come to the right person there were houses for homes and
exiles he said that they had taken some people out of houses that were
going to be provided for exiles that had returned home
what organisation did he belong to
we didn’t get to a stage where he stipulated when we could
move into these houses so i said that i’d come again but i had a
financial problem at the time i would go to the dtc to get a small
grant i had to go to town to do a quotation we made our quotation but
we were told that it was too much money
what you’re saying is not clear are you talking about the
anccr in king william’s town that looked after exiles who had come back
yes we went and there was just not enough money we would get
temporary jobs in town now and again it was difficult to get this
accommodation from joe i went with the one comrade from the transkei to
johannesburg even there we didn’t find accommodation so we came back
	in april i went to joe again when i got there there were a lot of
other people that i did not know it was on a saturday afternoon and when
i got inside the house there were ladies in the lounge and i told them
that i was looking for joe joe said that it had been a long time since
he last saw me and i asked him how far he’d got with looking for
accommodation i said that there was accommodation elsewhere that i might
take it was about four o’clock in the afternoon and he said that i must
come back at about eleven pm so i left
	after i’d walked about two hundred metres from his house i thought that
it would be too late at night and where i was going to wait i wasn’t sure
if i’d find anyone i went back to his house and when i got there i told
him the appointment at eleven pm was going to take too long he took
yes he pointed this gun at me and i thought he was just
playing around but he said i must lift up my hands which i did he
did he find anything in your pockets
no i did not even have a knife they took me outside there
was a car parked there and they pushed me together with the other two men
and said i must be put in the boot of the car i asked why and refused
they were with him after that i said i would not get into the
boot but i’d get into the car so i got into the car and there were two
men sitting on either side of my the driver started the car and he drove
off he drove up douglas smith street when we reached the sea area he
said that he must drive down gombo and they parked next to the house and
went inside i was left with the driver inside the car and he asked me
what was going on i said i don’t know i asked him for a cigarette i
remember he smoked courtleigh i smoked and they came back but i didn’t
know what was going on joe came back and told the driver to drive off
we drove up douglas smith back to mdantsane as he was coming towards
mdantsane he said that we must go under the bridge at senate park and joe
ordered the driver to park the car at the side the doors were opened and
i felt a stab on my back then another wound at the back of my neck and i
could not walk they dragged me towards the bushes and put me on my back
they stabbed me twice on my chest
what were they hitting you with
they hit me with a baton twice on my chest but they did not
stab me i stayed there the whole night it was a saturday the following
morning at about between eight and nine a man who stayed in senate park
saw me and asked what was going on i told him that it was joe who did
this to me and i asked him to call an ambulance i tried to crawl but it
was too difficult this man was standing next to me and he saw another
no but i can remember his structure he asked me if i knew who
the perpetrators were i said no i only knew joe he asked whether joe
and tetena were the same person and i said i don’t know he said he would
not call an ambulance but he would go directly to joe’s place i think he
was driving a bakkie he said he would force them to come and fetch me i
asked him to call an ambulance because i had internal bleeding and i was
feeling cold an ambulance came and i went to hospital i stayed in
hospital for about a week at the weekend i requested to leave the
hospital this is the day that comrade chris passed away
chris hani i got out of hospital on the day that he was
buried i came back to the township after that interrupted
excuse me mr leleki what did the doctor diagnose
they stabbed me towards my spine my whole right side was not
functioning i could not stand they would prick me with needles and i
couldn’t feel anything i couldn’t even urinate after that
i asked who were you talking to
i was talking to myself that i was going to the office to
report what these people had done to me these people who were referred to
the anc offices i went and reported this matter but
personally i cannot say that joe should be arrested he must say where he
got the information from that i worked together with the police joe came
and admiral and we talked about this matter i told joe that i wasn’t
going to do anything to joe because i did not know anything about him he
was just supposed to get accommodation for me i told him that his
responsibility was to pay my bill at the hospital he must have paid
because i never received letters which i otherwise would have received
from the hospital after that nothing ever happened we continued with
when you met with joe at the offices did he give evidence as to
why he said that you were an informer were the others not there
no he didn’t give any clear evidence and he couldn’t even
answer questions which i put forward
so he did not give satisfactory evidence did he deny that he’d
did he again say that you worked together with the police
yes he said i went to him carrying an uzzi and he said that
he was able to disarm me i asked him where that uzzi was and i told him
that he would not have been able to disarm me
in conclusion you would like joe to clarify why he is accusing
i thought that as he is here maybe we’ll hear what he has to
is that all mr leleki i’m not going to go into further details
thank you mr leleki thank you mr chairman
mr leleki according to your evidence you don’t know the names
of the four people that were with mr jordan
but you’d recognise them if you saw them
i only know joe jordan he would list these people
yes the one had a scarf covering half of his face i remember
the driver though because i think he was just hired i don’t think he
why do you think he was hired
because he did not look hard hearted and he was also asking me
would you be able to identify him
thank you mr leleki we’ll give mr jordan a chance to answer
and respond to your evidence you may step down thank you
we would like mr tws jordan to come forward i don’t
whether mr opperman is here mr jordan in your letter you said that mr
opperman will represent you but he is not here
i decided to come here alone
thank you we welcome you mr jordan we request that you give
we don’t have time and there are a lot of people to be
listened to today therefore we would appreciate it if people do not
disturb us so that we can finish our work in time mr jordan please take
mr jordan we’ll hand over to you to give us your testimony and
after hat we will ask you a few questions to get some clarity i hand
mr chairperson i thank you for the opportunity that my
colleague mr leleki is here today before the truth and reconciliation
commission to come and give evidence of what happened on this particular
day the tenth if i’m not mistaken was not the first time that i met him
i used to meet him previously an appointment was made by a lady named
noxhawe for him to come and see me this is not the noxhawe working for
the truth commission after a while he came to me on this particular day
on the first day noxhawe came with a young man by the name of subu from
umlahzi when they introduced themselves to me leleki also introduced
excuse me mr jordan noxhawe and subu do you know their
no i don’t know their surnames sir they said that leleki was
looking for a place to stay because he cam from durban i told him it is
very difficult to find a place to stay in the area in which he wanted to
stay because we would have to go the street committee of that area and it
will be the street committee that would introduce him to the area
committee he will get a paper from his area and after that they will be
able to help him find a place but i was not sure whether he would find a
place to stay he asked me to make these arrangements with the
chairperson of the street committee which i did but he didn’t come back
i met noxhawe and gave her the report that there would be a meeting but i
wasn’t present at that meeting he was supposed to go to that meeting to
ask for a place to stay after a while he came back for the second time
with two men one of them was smu the one who said he was from durban he
was speaking a bit of zulu they came to check this place at that time
there was no decision taken concerning the place of stay i’m not going
to say that there was a promise that he was going to get a house as he
said but what happened was that on the day of the incident he came to my
home at about twelve after we found out that comrade chris had passed
away i was alone i’d just finished my dinner there were people all over
in the streets after chris’s death he said to me he was given an order
and i asked him who gave him this order and what was the order he said
that admiral sent him because there was a mission to be done in his unit
in which he was going to be attached from the unit of umkhonto wesizwe i
questioned this because i met admiral on the previous day i couldn’t
understand why there was a direct order from the regional commander of
which there was a subregional office and if there was a mission to be
commissioned it had to go through the subregional office it didn’t
happen in this way i said that i’m not going to defy this order i’ll
follow it i asked where we were going to work and he said we will come
and pick you up and we will get an order of the operation of how we are
going to operate i accepted the order as he was like a commander at the
time because he was the one given this order and i obeyed the order smu
came to me driving a honda with a number plate with nd on it it was a
maroon honda he took me and when we were approaching a corner there were
three people in the car one of them was mr leleke we became five in the
car when we were approaching the senate park area let me go back i
first asked who is going to provide us with the material for the mission
to be accomplished and he said that we were given the dl 
where we will be getting the material for this operation but when we got
to the place where we were going the problem was that smu asked when we
were going to get the material and who was going to provide us with this
material because it was not there i said that he said to me he is the
one who is going to give us the material smu said that he is an
organiser of this material and this is where the source of the conflict
came about we were there but there was no material and most of us like
myself i was not armed and i did not know that others were armed when a
mission like this was pulled there was supposed to be material maybe
they expected me to bring the material but i didn’t know what was going
to happen that was the cause of the conflict and smu said that he was
pulling out he was going to leave us a language which was used on such
operations was used that if you pull out you must leave your head behind
because the information that was the beginning of the conflict they
confronted each other he pulled out a gun from his back we were
standing in the bush there were four of us at the time we left the
fifth one in the car the conflict started there when he pulled out his
gun smu approached him and i grabbed gun smu pulled out a knife and he
stabbed him in the process i did not intervene because i didn’t know
whether this was a trap but i could see that there was a conflict
concerning the issue of this material
	when i tried to intervene i was at a distance and the gun was with me i
said smu you are going to take me home because there is a conflict now
the gun was with me and he did not hesitate smu did not hesitate i
understood that he had no firearm with him and i said that he must drive
the car i had a gun with me when i was about to get into the car i took
out a magazine and i gave it to the others so that if he comes back to
these others he must not come back with a gun taken from me with bullets
	the following day between half past seven and eight a man by the name of
xhaxha came he said there is a person accusing you of injuring him
together with the people you were with and he said let us go and see this
person we went there and when i got there there was an ambulance and he
was being taken by the ambulance to the hospital he then took me back
home the office of the regional command sent a message that i was
supposed to be in the office
	when i got to the office there were regional officers there one of the
people who were there was admiral vanti mr leleki was also there
admiral said that there was this conflict and he said that leleki was
complaining that when this was happening we accused of being an informer
i’m not going to go into details about this matter
	after that he was to tell his story in front of me he said he wanted to
know the people who accused him of being an informer and secondly he
wanted his medical expenses to be paid i could see that he was tense and
i could see that he suspected there were certain people who told me about
him being an informer we dealt with the issue of payment of medical
expenses it was then said that unfortunately there was no one amongst us
working at that time it was then decided that although i was not
responsible for his injuries i was there when he was injured and at that
time all of us were unemployed in this issue of an informer they asked
them to tell them where i got this information i said that maybe that
came through when i left them if they suspected him as an informer i’m
not going to answer because i left there before he was accused of being
an informer we were then given an order to pay the medical expenses and
	for a long time i was unemployed and he used to come and visit me at
home on the weekends and there was no problem i was then employed and
he knew that i was employed because he was the person who used to visit
me he said that he was still having a problem with a place to stay and
he was happy that i was employed he wanted him to help him to build a
shack in duncan village i assisted him in terms of money i gave him
money so that he would be able to build his shack he then came back to
me because he had a problem with his girlfriend i’m not sure if his
girlfriend was pregnant or not but there was a problem i again assisted
him financially so that he doesn’t have a problem because we were like
friends at that time after that he went to walmansthal to the
integration of forces what surprised me was that there was conflict
between him and the people who were in my unit he accused them of being
responsible in the attempted murder on his life they wanted to fight but
	 i thought that when he was testifying he would be able to name these
people because i don’t know the people he was with there was that
situation of the conflict between him and myself lastly what also
shocked me was that i thought he was going to say that if he was not
satisfied in this issue he would go back to the organisation as we talked
this in the organisation but i heard that he came to the commission to
report this matter that is not my problem because it is his right that
if people are appearing before the commission he has a right to come and
appear before the commission i cannot deny him his rights
	in the original statement i got he said that he wanted me to apologise
to him publicly but i think it would be important if i had to apologise
to him publicly as i’ve already told you what happened i don’t want to
deny him the right for him that he wanted me to apologise in public i do
apologise in public because i was there and i did not stop what was
happening but i would like the commission to judge whether he deserves my
apology or not and i hope that in this situation as we are here at the
truth commission i hope that it will resolve problems existing already
and i’m very reluctant to go to those specific problems because they
belong to my organisation i have apologised publicly because i did not
avoid this situation there will be no more attempts on my life as the
last one was on the fifteenth of december i’m hoping that now it’s the
end because i’m tired of being combat ready at a time when we are no
longer ready to fight so i hope i’m not putting to him that he’s party to
that but i’m saying that i’ve been suspicious in all these attempts of
which direction they are coming from
	i now hope that the people who are present will understand that if they
have a problem with me there is only one channel and that is to go to the
truth commission that is what i think
thank you mr jordan i have only one question for you the
question is the people you were with in the car are they still alive
mr chairperson if those people were organised by me to be part
of the attempt on his life when i apologised i would have told you that
they are still alive and i know who they are but i don’t know them
the four people who were in the car the one you know as smu
i knew two people leleki and smu
in other words smu will be able to come and testify on this
smu visited my twice with leleki in my home those were the
two people i knew in that car when they got into the home they were both
coming form uhmlazi and the other two said they were coming from uhmlazi
and they were working in his unit in durban
you said that what you know is that he was smu you don’t know
no i don’t know his surname he told me his surname but at
that time it was not important to keep somebody’s surname
thank you mr chairperson where is admiral
if i’m not mistaken i think he is a lieutenant colonel in the
xhaxha you referred to do you know his full names
no he introduced himself to me as xhaxha
yes i saw him in butterworth
the man mr leleki referred to that found him lying there did
this is the man who came to pick me up the following morning
and when we got there the ambulance was there taking him to the hospital
this man was xhaxha the one whom i said i met twice in butterworth
thank you mr jordan thank you mr chairperson
mr jordan i’m sure you’ll agree with me this is a very
complicated story it is very strange that mr leleki and yourself don’t
know the people who were in the car and you cannot identify them to us
because i think the people who were in the car should be able to
corroborate either your story or his story you were in a sensitive
operation and you did not know each other however if we can solve this
complication we will try to solve it if we cannot solve this
complication maybe the commanders of umkhonto wesizwe will try and solve
it within the code of umkhonto wesiezwe but i think umkhonto wesizwe is
no longer there but the then commanders of umkhonto wesizwe will try to
solve this within the anc if we can we will try and solve it but it
looks like a very complicated story we thank you for your testimony
thank you mr chairperson i would like to greet you mr mtele
the story you are going to present before us concerns yourself and you
wife mrs florida thembega mtele you’re going to tell us what happened
on the second of february is that correct
yes that is correct but let me correct the year
please tell us briefly what happened to you
when i got home at about eleven after a udf meeting the window
was opened and i told my wife to close the window and we went to bed it
was very hot that day and we slept on top of the blankets at about one
in the morning we woke up and the house was in flames i tried to wake
her there were flames and smoke all over the house we tried to open the
kitchen door but it could not open which made it clear that the door was
locked from the outside so that we could not open it and all the windows
were burglar proofed we spent about thirty minutes inside the house and
our neighbours tried to break down the door so that we could get out we
were then taken to the cecilia makiwane hospital
were you also burnt or was the house only burnt down
our bedroom was burnt down as well as ourselves
you were injured and then you were taken to hospital
yes we were injured and taken to hospital
how were you injured and for how long did you stay in hospital
i stayed in hospital for three weeks and my wife for six weeks
she was the one who was badly injured because i woke up and she woke up
please tell us why did this happen do you know why your house
i don’t know why our house was burnt down i cannot tell you
because i don’t know and nothing happened to my knowledge which could
lead to such an incident accept that i was involved in political
activities and i think that there were people fighting against that
did you know who the perpetrators were
no even today we don’t have any idea but we did lay a charge
was there a witness who saw this and if there was who was
it was noxaba who was out neighbour who said that she could not
sleep that night and when she heard the bombs she woke up and opened the
window she saw two people and when they saw her they ran away one of
these people were aiming at our bedroom and the other one at the dining
room noxaba saw them at that time and they then ran away
unfortunately she didn’t see who they were
no she did not recognise them
these bombs what happened to them did they all explode
fortunately for us none of these bombs exploded i think that
they got scared when they saw noxaba they gave our dogs food so that
sir you said that there were people who tried to save you who
our neighbours and people from the community
the damaged costs were plus minus sixty thousand
did you manage to take out any furniture
our bedroom furniture and the dining furniture was burnt out
did you get any help from the government as this used to
no we didn’t get any help from the government we only got help
from the border council of churches
so you managed to rebuild your house
yes we managed to do that especially the doors and the windows
sir please tell us what else happened in the community did
this happen to other people who were members of your organisation or to
people who were against your organisation
nothing happened from the organisations that were against our
organisation but the ciskeian police used to assault and beat people and
i suspect that the people who did this to me were the ciskeian police but
you said that you laid a charge but this did not go any
do you have a request to the commission
my request to the commission is that i would like the people
who did this to me to come forward i would like them to confess and to
tell us who authorised them to do this that would satisfy us
thank you sir is that all
thank you i will hand over to the chairperson
mr mtele we thank you very much were you working at the
border council of churches at the time of the incident
yes that’s correct and i was also inaudible at that time
i do remember this incident i also remember that it was clear
that they wanted to kill you it was only god who saved you we thank you
for coming forward with your story because you’re giving us a
responsibility to investigate who the perpetrators were i don’t know
whether we are going to be able to answer all people’s questions as there
are questions which are going to be left unanswered accept if the
perpetrators would come forward and confess to their deeds but we will
try to investigate as much as we can
	we would like to thank you for reminding us of this incident and such
incidents happened a lot in this region to people who were leaders in the
organisations fighting for liberation thank you sir
we now call frances njoli maki michael mose and lindiswa
ngwenya there’s a fourth person is he going to testify over to you
please give us your names sir
thank you mr chairperson mrs njoli i will start with you
the story you presented before the commission is about yourself you were
injured during the issue of the bus boycott here in mdantsane please
tell us briefly what happened to you
it was about a quarter past four when i left home before we
got to the station we saw that there were many people around and there
were also buses we heard a voice saying that we must go to the buses and
people said that they weren’t going to go to the buses a whistle was
then blown people ran away and i fell down i tried to ask for help
because i was shot and i couldn’t stand up
	people came and tried to find a car to take me to hospital they then
found mr malgas’s car and i’m very sad that he’s not here today because
he saved my life i was then taken to the cecilia makiwane hospital i
didn’t want to be taken out of the car because at that time my leg was
very painful the bullet struck me in my thigh i was then taken by car
to the hospital and i told them not to take me out of the car because i
had a lot of pain they said they are going to take me out because they
were trying to save my life i was taken to the theatre there was one
person in the theatre i don’t know whether this person was shot there
was another lady from nu plus a nurse i was waiting for a doctor to
operate on me this lady was nurse senip she said that we are very happy
that you were shot she asked why are you not using the buses this
caused the conflict between herself and the nurses there were three of
us in the car at the time but i don’t remember the third person we were
in ward no which was never used before
	after i was treated no one was allowed to come and visit us our
children wanted to come and visit us but they couldn’t because the police
stopped them sebe said that nobody was allowed to visit us this was
very painful to us because we couldn’t see our children the specialists
came to us trying to treat us and they were arrested there was one from
transkei and he was arrested as well
	i spent six months in hospital i have thirteen pins in my body a
doctor from overseas doctor floris treated me my leg wasn’t straight
after the operation and this doctor came and helped me i thank this
doctor because if it wasn’t for him my leg would have to have been
amputated he treated me and he said that my leg would be straight after
his treatment i stayed in hospital for six months the nurses took me to
physiotherapy trying to help me i had five children and i was working
in the tea room at ruiters at the time my employers tried to help my
	after spending six months in hospital i was discharged and i went back
home i stayed at home trying to get a pension i was working for black
people at the time my two children bugelo and bulelo were educated
because i was working for the black people i couldn’t work properly and
the doctors advised me to get a special shoe because if i didn’t i would
be paralysed i tried to get a pension but they said that i was able to
get work so i cannot get a pension i was working for miss simone for
eighty rand and miss makonto for forty rand
	i would like to thank the lord because my children managed to do
standard ten my four children completed matric and the other one got
married one of them is in fort hare university the two are in
johannesburg looking for work i’m also suffering i cannot say that i’m
employed fulltime it’s only a job you have to try and support yourself
these days and i would like to thank the lord for not taking my life so
that i can support my children so that i can try any means to see that
my children will be educated i thank the lord
	i would like to thank you for this opportunity for being here today i
didn’t want to come here because i thought that i would feel pain we
were suffering at the time and we were praying to the lord and today we
would like to thank the lord for this truth and reconciliation
commission we would be very glad if the people who did these things to
us could come forward and tell the commission what they did to us i’m
thankful for this day but i didn’t want to come here mr sam gave me the
money to come here because when i thought back i knew that because of
sebe i was not injured but now i’m injured and disabled i was one of the
people who paid three hundred rand priscilla and tzinzi paid this amount
of money for me our lawyer was priscilla djali in johannesburg as she
was very far she could not handle our case it was then transferred to
pringle and i went to mark rabe who told me to go to east london to
pringle priscilla djali tried to pay this amount of money the three
hundred rand we would have been arrested if we didn’t pay that money we
were not working at the time but priscilla helped us and she paid the
thank you ma’am you have given us a clear picture of what
happened i would like to ask about the three hundred rand what was this

maki michael mose mr mose you’re going to talk about luyanda
eric mose how are you related to him
was he affected during this bus boycott
no he disappeared in he was at philemon high school this
was during the cosas time on the thirty first of october in 
according to the statement before us he disappeared during
the time of the bus boycott after being illtreated by the ciskeian
police could you tell us exactly what happened
i’m going to hand over to his younger brother
lundi perhaps you can help us
thank you for this opportunity to speak about my elder brother
as my father just said it was in he disappeared on the morning of
the rst of october we used to share a bed he would wake up before me
whilst our parents were still sleeping and warm up some water to have a
bath and then he’d go to my parents room to get money for the daily
dispatch newspaper and a loaf of bread he did that as usual he was
given money to go and buy the daily dispatch and bread at nogos this was
when the lennox sebe building was still there my brother never came back
from the shop years passed and we did not know where my brother was
	in or ‘ balulwana from lusaka wrote to us as the family saying
that my brother is in exile at the anc camps in lusaka i’m sad when
speaking of this letter this letter was taken by a comrade from exile
who was going to look for my brother we could not find this letter
yesterday or today after luyanda’s disappearance we were never happy at
home and there was never peace because the special branch and the
soldiers would come to my house looking for luyanda and we did not know
where he was we also wanted to know where he was
	on day when i was at school and my father was at work the special
branch came according to my mother they searched the house upside down
and they found a cosas card on which was written luyanda eric mose this
card was an identification that he was a cosas member they found his
album and looked for photographs they would ask my mother why my brother
would have his fist up in all his pictures they left the album behind
it was their mistake because after they left my mother thought that
they’d come back for these pictures so she dug a hole in the garden and
	as we were looking for my brother in those years the soldiers came the
one night at about midnight i think they surrounded my yard it was
myself my father and my mother at home my father asked who it was and
they demanded that we open the door as my father was about to open the
door he put the light on outside and they demanded that he should switch
it off there was a multitude of soldiers around the house one of the
soldiers badges fell and we kept it at home
they searched looking for luyanda and we told them that luyanda
after how long did they leave
after quite a while they said that if luyanda comes back we’d
have to inform them we didn’t know exactly what they wanted from luyanda
lundi how old was luyanda when he disappeared when was he
was there any conflict between luyanda and the police before
he disappeared why did he go into exile
luyanda was a very quiet boy even my parents didn’t know
exactly what kind of person he was because he wasn’t a person who opened
up he liked to go and visit my maternal grandmother my grandmother
would chase him away after he found the cosas documents because my
grandmother did not know about these things this is why he was harassed
we were shocked when my grandmother explained to my mother that my
	in we got a phone call at my mother’s place we do not have a phone
at home but my mother’s place is very modern so there was a phone my
brother phoned saying that he’d gone to london to school my uncle asked
who took him to london to school and he said the organization he said
he was an mk therefore he was an anc member and he’d gone to study in
lundi according to your statement you said that luyanda
disappeared and organizations were unbanned people came home but luyanda
never came home what do you know
we only know of the last call saying that he was in london
people came back from exile there were elections and we were still
searching for my brother we’d go to the anc offices together with my
father we’d go to human rights attorneys and they’d send us back to the
anc offices but we got no information about my brother as i read in the
media i thought that the truth and reconciliation commission would be
the correct channel for me to come and make a statement about my brother
perhaps there could be a lead as you would investigate his whereabouts
my father mr mose searched for my brother and he was called to the
majaga offices this year where they filled in forms we received a reply
from the department of finance in pretoria for a special pension fund
also referring to my brother as a deceased we were in turmoil because
they were speaking about both the pension fund and about the deceased i
made a copy of this letter and took it straight to the truth commission’s
offices at the nbs to discuss it i reported this matter and we then
got this letter whilst we were waiting to appear before the commission i
asked the people at the commission to interpret for me they said that we
must go back to the place where my dad had filled in the form
excuse me lundi you’re talking about the majaga offices what
they are anc and pac offices
so up to this day you do not know what has happened to luyanda
mose what is your request before the commission
as i made my statement before the truth commission i requested
that if especially in the african national congress the commanders that
were in exile could please reveal my brother’s whereabouts i highlighted
that point especially ronnie kasrils and modise because they were the
people that were in charge in exile even the late chris hani i’m
concerned that he left us because he’s one of the people who passed away
and how they died whilst in exile if my brother passed away whilst in
exile we need a proper burial a memorial perhaps the reason why things
are not going well at home is because we don’t know what happened to my
thank you both of you i only have one last person there’s a
man called cindele mfazi who’s the last person to have seen him in
lusaka have you spoken to cindele
thank you cindele is the person i talked about the letter that
luyanda wrote whilst in lusaka cindele was requested by my parents to
investigate about luyanda he said he would and he’d seen my brother in
angola in not in lusaka in angola in we gave this letter to
cindele who was going to investigate amongst other it was evident then
that my brother was in exile because cindele had seen him as well miss
can i proceed with lindiswa lindiswa you are also going to give
testimony about yourself is that so 
you were also shot on this particular day when people were
shot because of the bus boycott in mdantsane
you’re story is different because you were shot inside your
please tell us exactly what happened to you
in i was a student at nowawe in berlin i used the
half past six train to go to school on the th of august i was getting
ready to go to school while i was going to the kitchen i heard gunshots
and i fell down as a result of the gunshots i don’t know who did this i
tried to ask for help i went to the toilet where i lost consciousness i
think people found me there and took me to cecilia makiwane hospital
where i spent a week i had been shot in my shoulders as well as my arm
and i had a cut in my ear i was treated in hospital and discharged after
that i was not feeling well and in i went back to cecilia makiwane
hospital where they operated on me they found another bullet which was
	in i received a letter saying that i have to pay a certain amount
of money for the costs of the court i went to mr siwisa because i needed
help and told him that i was the one who was shot but i had to pay money
siwisa said i have to pay this amount of money because i didn’t appear in
court and the people who were supposed to represent us didn’t i paid
	in i went back to mr siwisa because i wanted to go back to school
i had to pay fifteen rand per week during that period i asked mr siwisa
to help me to go back to school and after i completed my schooling i
would pay this money back he wrote letters asking for permission for me
to go back to school after three years i was working for the dec when i
received a letter saying that i had to pay the balance of this money i
then went back to mr siwisa and requested him to write a letter to these
people to inform them that i can only pay fifty rand per month in i
how much money was this lindiswa
it was eight hundred and twenty rand at the beginning but it
increased because of interest and it was over two thousand rand i do
have a salary advice with me showing that they were deducting fifty rand
did you stay away from school for three years because of this
yes and i requested these people to wait until i had
completed my studies when i started working i received another letter
saying that i have to pay the balance
your attorneys mr siwisa did they explain to you why you have
he said that these were the costs of the court if you
didn’t appear in court you would receive certain letters warrants
because he was arrested at that time and didn’t appear in court so i was
the one who was supposed to pay this money
let us now go back how old were you at the time of this
i was born on the th of november i’m thirty four
years old now i’m thirty five years old now
did you manager to complete your studies after this break
yes i did because mr siwisa was trying to help me while i
was still at school i then managed to complete my studies
did you see the people who shot you or were you inside the
i was inside the house in the kitchen i heard a gunshot
and that’s when i was shot
is that all you wanted to say or do you have something else to
add what are your requests to the commission
my request to the commission is because i was the one who
was injured and the one who got shot i would like to get my money back
as you had bullets in your shoulders how do you feel now
there are certain days when i feel pain in my arm when i
went to the clinic they told me that i had arthritis
would you like some more medical treatment
yes because i still go to the clinic to get treatment for
is that all you wanted to say ma’am
thank you i will now hand over to the chairperson there
might be questions from my colleagues for you to explain certain issues
thank you mr chairperson my first question is to lindiswa
you were shot while you were inside the house
during this conflict in mdantsane when people were shot by the
police was it a normal or unusual thing that a person would be shot
no it was not normal it happened to me
don’t you find it strange that while you were shot inside the
house and you had to pay the government because you were shot
yes this is strange to me
this is very strange to you
yes it is very strange to me sir
thank you i have another question for mr mose mr mose accept
for the man you mentioned the one who said that he saw your brother in
exile is there anyone else who saw him in exile
no it’s only cindele who came from exile and he saw my brother
there are no other young men who left the country at the time
that your brother left the country who came back
on the day of his disappearance we didn’t know where he was we
just heard that he was in lusaka he left home alone while we were
are there any people who belonged to the same organization who
no i don’t know but as cindele explained to us he left after
my brother but he managed to see him in exile in angola
thank you thank you mr chairperson
mrs frances njoli and lindiswa ngwenya i would like to thank
you when i thank all the people who were affected by the bus boycott but
the case of luyanda eric mose is different from your cases it’s
concerning a person who disappeared in exile i would like to thank you
for coming forward with your story and i would to assure you that when
the anc appeared before the commission for the second time are you
i’m saying that you made a request for us to investigate the
disappearance of luyanda he disappeared in exile in the hands of the
anc i was saying that when the anc appeared before the commission for
the second time to answer questions it gave out a document which
consisted of people’s names who were injured in the camps in exile i’m
not sure whether mr mose’s name is there because all the documents are in
cape town even if the name is there or not the anc assured us that they
would try to help us as a commission together with the people who’s
relatives disappeared in exile whether they were killed by the enemy
whether they were killed by their own comrades whether they were killed
in the camps or whichever way they were killed the anc said they would
help us to try and answer questions of parents like you because it is
very painful that your child went into exile trying to fight for the
liberation and when others returned yours doesn’t and there’s no
explanation as to what happened to him in exile whether he was killed or
not we would like the truth to be known and we will be in contact with
you we will try to investigate and if we can we will come up with an
answer and we’ll inform you of our findings from the anc organization
	i thank you alone because although your case was at the same time as the
bus boycott it deals is about a person who disappeared in exile thank
you our logistics officer had an announcement where is he all the
people who are here who came to make statements we will take a lunch
break and we’ll come back at two o’clock
nomhase nkenke i would like to apologise to her because she
was supposed to be the first one according to our list but because we
wanted to start with the bus boycott incident we forgot her name we
thank her for waiting for such a long time
thank you mr chairman good afternoon mrs nkenke i’m sorry
that you’ve had to wait as our commissioner has said to you you are here
to tell us about i’ll start again we welcome you you are here to
tell us about bongani nkenke what relationship was he to you
the events you’re going to tell us about is a memorial
service that was held nine years after the massacre at eggerton station
will you tell us what happened to him on that occasion please carry on
it was the rd of august and we were going to a prayer
meeting days elapsed and he didn’t come back i asked his friends if
they didn’t see him but they said they didn’t see him one week lapsed
into another one and the police would come not even getting out of the
police van i’d ask the children playing outside after the second
week a little girl said that she’d heard that bongani had been shot we
went to unit in mdantsane at the mortuary and asked them for a corpse
that would have been brought in on the first of august they did show us
the corpse the police then requested that they be taken to the child
that gave the report that bongani had been shot this child said that
he’d been talking about a different bongani we tried to explain to this
child that we just wanted the truth they gave up apparently bongani had
been brought in by the policemen from unit who were referred back to
them we spoke to the policeman who was handling this case and he said
that he’d been shot whilst trying to burn down a policeman’s house
apparently there were warning shots and he got shot we were shown what
they had with them there were containers and i realised that these
containers were not dirty as if someone was going to burn down a house
because there was just water in the containers these were containers
that they’d taken to the place of prayer
	my husband and i received a letter to go to court and we were told to
get an attorney we were confused and we didn’t know what was happening
or why we needed legal representation we had to appear in court but they
kept on postponing the date until they stopped and that was that
i just want to interrupt you at that point and ask you did
you at that stage seek any advice from an attorney
we didn’t go to any attorney
carry on then please i’m just going to stop you for a
moment as i’m not receiving any interpretation will you carry on now
when the coffin arrived at the graveyard a car came with it
and in the car was two policemen the perpetrator and another one when
we came back from the graveyard the car was there again this policemen
talked to the girl that had given us a report these police went to my
brother asking questions and my brother was angry saying that they should
shoot him as well because he didn’t know what they wanted from the nkenke
mrs nkenke you say that they said you had to go to court
i don’t know whether it was an inquest because they called
the policeman and a few ladies who would go on the stand and talk about
this incident they didn’t care about us at all or explain what was
were there any members of your families there at all
were you asked any questions at all
at the funeral the policemen that was there asking the
i don’t know because they would talk to the kids outside
the house that was allegedly burnt down whose house was
i don’t know it was just a report that we got from the police
station this child that told us that bongani had passed on had only seen
bongani and it was the police that told us about the house
what is your opinion what do you think really happened
so you have come to this commission so that we can help to
find out the truth in this case but it will be difficult in the light of
the facts that we’ve got so far but we will attempt to do this who is
the friend who saw him shot at the highway who is that friend is that
the child that you’re talking about
the same child is there anything else that you want the
commission to do for you mrs nkenke
i want to know why and where my child was shot i want the
perpetrator to come forward because i want to hear it from his mouth
thank you mrs nkenke i’m going to hand you back to our
thank you mr chairman mrs nkenke was there any particular
incident on the day your child was shot
yes there was going to be a prayer meeting concerning the
were there others that were shot with your son
you did not hear of any other people
a policeman at unit he was a policeman then
no i just heard about him
mrs nkenke we thank you and we apologise again for having
made you wait for such a long time as mrs crichton said we’ve heard your
request that you would like us to investigate this matter there are a
lot of things that we would like you to help us with because at the
moment it will not be easy for us to get answers but our investigators
will be coming to talk to you we’ll endeavour to find out the truth for
you if we do not find out anything we trust that you will understand we
will meet again at half past nine tomorrow morning the hearing for the
can i ask you to stand whilst i swear you in mrs doreen
i welcome you doreen rousseau and june crichton will direct
your questions to you on behalf of the panel
thank you mr chairperson good morning mrs rousseau are
very nervous but i’m comfortable thanks
i can see that i want you just to relax your testimony
will not take as long as we’ve hear the full story and so it won’t be
necessary for you to go through the whole thing except for you to add any
points that you’d like make that perhaps mr belling senior and junior
left out about what happened to you would you like to just tell us what
happened and then we’ll ask you questions at the end of that time
on the evening of the first of may two friends and i
went to the airport to fetch a fellow colleague from there on our way
back we called in at the high gate hotel for a quick drink we went in
and the four of us sat at a table at the centre of the bar we ordered
drinks and were sitting talking laughing and joking when we heard
something like crackers going off not long thereafter someone shouted
get down the hotel is being attacked soon after that i heard shots being
fired and looked towards the door and saw a man wearing a black balaclava
with an automatic rifle firing from left to right in the bar i ran
around the table to lie down where my friends were and i was shot in the
back of the leg i fell down and noticed that from the top of my right
leg above the knee blood was spurting out of a wound about the size of my
hand then someone from behind the bar fired shots back and after a while
the firing stopped i said the my friend on my right i’ve been shot and
he said lie still pretend that you’re dead because they may come back my
friend on the left was lying face down i shook him and called his name
but he lay very still everybody was screaming and lying in pools of
blood they were choking as a result of the teargas the blood was still
spurting out of my leg and my friend attempted to stop the bleeding by
putting his elbow in the hole but without success
	i heard someone shout phone for an ambulance and the police i tried to
slide myself into a corner thinking that the attackers may return and
shoot at us again but i couldn’t move my leg i could feel myself getting
very weak as i was losing a lot of blood after some time the ambulance
arrived and my friend and i were taken to hospital i was in terrible
pain and the blood kept on spurting out i can’t remember what happened
thereafter i woke up in the ward the next morning and remained in the
hospital for plus minus a month i underwent surgery four times a pin
was placed in my injured leg from the hip to the knee and cannot be
	after leaving hospital i went daily for physiotherapy for a year and
during that period i went for another operation a bone graft i walked
on crutches for two and a half years and had to depend on other people
for assistance my life was changed overnight i lost my job and my
medical aid i had to go to a psychologist for counselling and was put
and medication for nerves and depression but i could not continue because
my medical aid had expired i am still on medication after a period of
four years and i still have problems with my injured leg being slightly
shorter and i walk with a limp i still experience a lot of pain and i
can’t walk very far as my knee and my ankle collapse i also have
absolutely no feeling in my foot due to the fact that the nerve had been
damaged my right hand was also injured when i was shot and i will have
to have surgery done in the near future my hearing in the right ear has
also been affected due to the gunshots i am a diabetic and this has
further aggravated it by the trauma of this incident i will be sixty one
years of age in july and have no husband to support me therefore i have
to depend on others for financial aid as i am only receiving a grant of
four hundred and thirty rand a month i feel that those responsible for
killing and injuring innocent people should be found and brought to
thank you doreen you’re saying that you still need
and part of that treatment will be surgery in the future
what is the prognosis for that surgery are they anticipating that it’s
yes i have problems here at the wrist and my thumb
and you say that you’re not on any medical aid
no i’m not on medical aid
so how would you anticipate paying for surgery such as
i don’t know i go to the state hospital the frere
you say you lost your job what kind of work were you
i was working at the spca at the animal sanctuary
and you are not working now
no i can’t work i can’t stand very long on my leg
you mentioned that your attitude towards the perpetrators
is very similar to that of mr belling would you like to explain on that
any further or add to that
well i just feel that innocent people were shot and injured
that night and i just feel that they should be found and brought to
so you are saying then that if you would you or would
you not like to meet the perpetrators of this event
no please i wouldn’t like to meet them
what are your expectations from the commission doreen
what are your expectations from the commission
well i would like help financially and i would like help
did you approach any attorney at all as mr belling did
any attorneys i did go to an attorney but he said that he
i can’t remember his name now it’s such a long time ago but
i can look up and let you know
if you could just give that information to our panel thank
you is there anything else that you wish to say about that attack that
i still have terrible nightmares i wake up in the night
and i see this man standing in my doorway with a gun
you mentioned that you had psychological treatment but
it’s now completed because lack of medical aid
yes my medical aid has expired
so that would be something that you would wish to continue
thank you very much mrs rousseau i’m going to hand you
i have a photograph here but i don’t if you want to see it
thank you mr chairman mrs rousseau i notice that in your
statement you make mention of a certain group with the name apla did you
know about this group before the shooting
what did you know or hear about them after the shooting
i didn’t hear anything i haven’t heard anything of them i
don’t know if they’ve been found or i’ve heard nothing
doreen rousseau thank you very much we will take the
statement that you have read to us and incorporate it with the statement
that is already with us here which is a written one we will request you
to perhaps give us a copy of the photograph if it’s possible because the
commission is going to be collecting all the photographs that have given
to us in this period of our work which depicts the pain that we have gone
through in this country we would like to have that preserved somehow for
the next generations to look at our history and see what has happened if
it’s possible for you to do that we will be prepared to pay for getting a
photograph made out of this one thank you
we now call linda sophia tonisi
thank you mr chairperson mrs tonisi you are here to talk about
masibulele maxwell tonisi is that correct
how are you related to him
your story is similar to the story already told by one of the
witnesses if i remember clearly the witness before the one was there
he left this country in but i’m not sure of the month
before going into details about his disappearance please tell
us briefly about his lifestyle before he left the country especially
i don’t have knowledge about his politics but it is clear
that he was a political activist because he died in angola when he was
involved in political activities in the township i wasn’t here because i
how old was he at that time
was he twenty three years old
was he working or was he still at school at the time
he was still at school but he had left school and got a job
let us start in mr tonisi when he left the country what
he left the country in when he came back from work the
days passed and he didn’t come back home because i was sleeping in my
employer’s home i didn’t know when he left
	the following week on a thursday my daughter said that the special
branch police from cambridge came asking for masibulele tonisi asking
his whereabouts and they said they did not know where he was the special
branch police said that he was in maseru and they asked for his parent
they told them that i’m at work and i would come back during the weekend
they came back the following week on thursday and i was at home they
asked me questions about him as to whether he was still at school how
old he was and where he was i said that i didn’t know and they told me
he was in maseru but they wanted him to come back to east london i asked
why and they said that the government was looking for him then i asked
them where i am going to find him
	they then left that thursday and the following week when i got home my
children told me the police came with three vans and they searched the
house saying they were looking for letters from masibulele in maseru my
children asked them how they knew that he was writing letters because he
didn’t write any letters to us the police would come now and then asking
about his whereabouts they also asked for my employers address and they
went there to ask the whereabouts of masibulele we heard that he was in
east germany and then after a while we heard he was in angola
excuse me mrs tonisi at the time you heard he was in germany
angola and all these places who was giving you this information
we would hear from people in the township that they were in
these different places we did not receive any letters from him and he
he didn’t give a message to a person from outside
no we did not even receive a letter from him but we read in
a newspaper in that he had passed away
these papers at the taxi rank and they had lists as well as
pictures of people who died in angola this man saw masibulele tonisi in
this list and because he knew our family he brought the list to us
that’s how we found out that he died in angola i then did nothing
because nobody came to tell me that he died
you did not find out what happened in angola and why he died
no i didn’t find out that is why i came here i would like
to know who killed him who buried him and why because i’m his mother and
is that your request mrs tonisi
yes i would like his bones to be exhumed
is that all ma’am or do you have any other requests
no i don’t have any other requests
thank you mrs tonisi thank you mr chairperson
mrs tonisi maybe you have already answered this question did
you have any contact with the anc after it was unbanned to try and find
you did not go to the anc offices
what was the reason why did you not got to them and ask them

thank you miss maya we request that mr ngikelana who is one
of the leaders of the day give us the background of what was happening
in the community at that time so that we can put this hearing in
thank you mr chairperson i am grateful to have this
opportunity to contribute towards the truth and reconciliation
commission i just want to clarify something the problem is i made my
statement in english but we’re apparently supposed to be speaking xhosa
it will seem as if i’m taking much longer because i’ll have to interpret
if i could speak in english it would go faster
please yourself you are allowed to use any language that you
are comfortable with if you would like to speak english it is all right
however the majority of the audience will have to get an interpretation
i will do it in xhosa mr chairperson for the sake of the
majority of the people mr chairperson what i’m going to try and put
forward to you is that there was a bus boycott in i’ll be speaking
of what led to the bus boycott as well as the results were i will
briefly be giving information regarding the contribution of work unions
and their leaders i was also a leader at the time mr chairperson in
july when we realized that the bus company in east london was going
to increase the bus fares by eleven percent i can’t remember the exact
figures people were not pleased at the time the workers were in
conflict with their employers for their rights the ciskeian government
of the day and the south african government of the day contributed
	at the time of the bus boycott new unions and new organizations had to
be formed to address problems such as this bus boycott the committee of
ten came about during that time it mostly consisted of workers because
they were the ones who used the buses the most at the time people then
switched from the buses to the trains the struggle for people’s rights
then moved from a bus situation to a train situation
	i would like to emphasize mr chairperson that truly these leaders that
were in the committee of ten were workers that were well known even
amongst trade unions it is true that these leaders were also accepted by
the community at large this is why when they supported and suggested
this bus boycott they were accepted by the community in mdantsane in
the early ‘’s the organizations that were fighting for people’s
rights speaking boldly about the oppression of people were the trade
unions political organizations were banned at the time therefore it was
the trade unions which could stand up for the people
	i’m going to tell you briefly about these unions sawu had a twenty
thousand signed membership it had a lot of followers in this area sawu
was working with twenty nine factories there was a union with a paidup
membership of about four thousand this is about eight food factories and
then the general workers union had about five hundred and fifty members
in three companies national automobile allied workers union had one
thousand seven hundred and sixty six members in one factory i’m just
trying to illustrate that this is how workers could boycott the increase
of bus fares at the time unions clearly stated that it was not their
custom to support a focus on boycotts but if the workers that belonged to
the unions had a problem with this eleven percent increase of bus fares
it was their obligation to support and help even though at around august
 the udf also had a lot of support from the unions this is how sawu
	the udf as an organization also had a lot of compassion for the people
who used the buses however as trade unions we endeavoured to help
workers with their problems especially with the authorities of the day
we received a document which we referred to as a twelve page document
it was clear that it was written by the government of the day this
document was to advise workers how they should work with the unions as
well as how they should go about relating especially to sawu
	the special branch at the time was always present at our boycotts it
was clear that the special branch had some kind of relationship with the
employers even though the employers would deny this fact this is what
caused all the conflict when the bus fares were increased mr
chairperson we should remember that two hundred and five people were
arrested by the ciskeian government of the day people from dimbaza and
mdantsane police stations were released and were very angry because they
had been severely illtreated and tortured people also felt that it was
their right to get decent salaries they were also angry that they could
not join sawu because they were told that if they’re members of sawu
they would lose their jobs and they would die of hunger we then
clarified to the workers that it was their prerogative to fight for their
rights this matter went to the anc and the south african communist
parties that were banned at the time we also had to be strong as unions
and stand up for the people as the bigger political organizations were
banned we had to ascertain and make sure that people were not oppressed
	i will proceed mr chairperson and i dwell on the leaders of the unions
at the time the general secretary of sawu was sam kekeni the president
was tsozamele xhewta and i was his assistant mr chairperson the
chairperson of sawu was eric umdonga we were was in and out of prison
being detained it was not the ciskeian police that were detaining us
then it was the south african government of the day the special branch
would also arrest us and interrogate us for hours on end however there
was nothing they could do because they would reach dead ends they would
say that it is not for the trade unions to educate people on the
struggle we made it clear to them that it the information we were
giving to workers corelates with that of the bigger organizations there
is nothing we could do that caused a lot of unrest they would be in and
out of our offices taking documents excuse me they would not take
documents they would just disrupt our work this kind of treatment did
not only apply to the leaders such as myself sometimes a worker in a
factory would be taken to cambridge and interrogated the workers would
be interrogated mostly about sawu what i’m trying to illustrate mr
chairperson is that a sawu lived under victimization and harassment
	in we started as a trade union until the bus boycott as i
mentioned earlier the ciskeian government was not happy about us all and
would not treat us well in there was an issue within the ciskeian
government the ciskeian government was considering banning sawu the
ciskeian government of the day perceived sawu as an organization under
the anc we clarified it and tried to convince them that we were a trade
union totally independent of the anc the ciskeian government would say
we are not just an anc front but also a communist front we were
committing communist activities within the country however we hid
nothing all our policies were out in the open and would be frankly
	what the ciskeian government was complaining about most is i don’t
exactly know how to put it in xhosa the policy of the ciskeian
government was to control labour and not to attract investments they
wanted money to be invested factories to be built but they saw trade
unions as people who were interfering with their investments we made it
clear that we wanted the companies to invest their money so that people
can get jobs but we wanted to respect people’s rights and to pay workers
according to their work as well as to improve their working conditions
the person in charge at that time made it clear that he would not
tolerate trade unions in the ciskei
	mr chairperson i would like to continue and talk about the people who
were detained by the ciskeian government in i will mention tandane
wine members of the general workers union twazamele xhoita umguzi
sifingo jeff mabela humphrey maklekwane and myself we were in and out
of detention sometimes when we were coming from negotiations the police
would wait for us and ask us about the negotiations i would also like to
mention mr vani ngodega in queenstown and the minister sydney mufamadi
together with mr mdigwa who came here under gaau general and allied
workers union they came to negotiate and talk to other unions and were
also detained for a few days in i would like to continue mr
chairperson to mention duluwas m inaudible who was also harassed
mr chairperson let me go back to the boycott itself as i’ve given the
	in august the ciskeians as we used to call them took five trade
unionists in east london i’d like to add that people like myself were
inside at the time mr tandane legoshi mjogolo meltafa and spingo were
taken by the ciskeian police mr mntonga sheba mambushi makligwana were
also arrested mr chairperson some of the people i’ve just mentioned
were members of the committee of ten i don’t remember clearly but mr
mambushi and mampunji were members of a committee of ten of ten after
that the ciskei banned sawu using the ciskeian national security act
they warned people who stayed in ciskei that if they continued being
members of sawu they would be punished severely sawu was accused of
started the bus boycott but if i remember correctly mr chairperson
there was a meeting called by the workers and the community to discuss
why the bus fares were increased under such conditions the president of
sawu tsozamele xhewta was not arrested he ran away he said that as a
leader in this region he would try to negotiate so that the bus boycott
would stop because people were killed and some were injured those who
were working for their children lost their jobs he made it clear that if
there are going to be negotiations regarding the bus boycott all the
leaders who were inside together with the committee of ten are to be
released without any conditions the members of the committee of ten
would be the ones leading the negotiations that was not accepted
	after that when things became very bad the bus company wanted sawu to
lead the negotiations concerning the bus boycott sawu then said that
it’s members who started the bus boycott the people who were the ones
supposed to be negotiating the bus boycott are in detention even at
that time nothing happened the leaders of the committee of ten were
not released what we must emphasize mr chairperson is that there was
conflict all the time and we became enemies with the government there
were also attempts from the leader of sawu tsozamele xhewta to try and
resolve this but his suggestions were not accepted and this caused
conflict between the communities and workers of mtanzane with the
ciskeian government the south african government and the employers
during this situation the unions were harassed in inappropriate way
	i would like say in english that during that time the unions were
highly politicized in a very distorted way strikes were equated to trade
unionism it was a very painful thing because we were fighting for
workers’ rights that is why when i was describing all this i mentioned
that we were trying to negotiate with different factories but what the
government did was it associated us with the strikes and the strikes
were the workers’ rights if they encountered a problem the shop stewards
and the organizers in the factory would be called by the managers and the
managers would tell them to stop what they are doing they would be told
that they were members of the anc and communist party the workers became
confused because of this fortunately they would be strong and unite
because they knew what they wanted from sawu and the general workers
	let us again go back to the issue of the boycott the leaders of sawu
myself and ntozi stated clearly that we are no longer going to be the
leaders of the boycott campaign because although this affected us we
wanted the workers to take a lead because they were the ones using the
bus to highway and to westbank we knew that if we could present this to
the workers the government would oppress them more this is when the
committee of ten was formed and were not denying that they were our
members it was formed so that it could consist of the workers and it
would give reports to the commuters that was the way it happened but we
cannot ignore the fact that the very same workers and the community at
large were looking to sawu as the leading organization in their struggle
of liberation fighting for the truth for democracy nonracialism and
	i would like to say that these are the events which took place in this
area at that time people like myself were in detention we went through
a hungers strike lasting twenty eight days i told the police that i came
from durban and when i arrived here i was arrested but i had nothing to
do with the bus boycott they said that i was arrested because i was a
member of sawu i was trying to create a picture of something i was told
about the workers were trying to state that there was a bus increase but
their wages were not increased and we as sawu members were accused of
leading this boycott i’ve mentioned names of certain leaders who were in
and out of detention not at the time of the boycott but before that
	again i would like to emphasize the aspect of the twelve page document
because it showed clearly that there were people who planned this but how
could they try and stop the struggle of the workers it became clear
during the bus boycott because the workers were fighting for their rights
and this was used as an excuse to try and arrest the union leaders
unfortunately it was clear that the unions recruited some members they
recruited members from grahamstown and queenstown and they never failed
because people accepted them as the unions for the workers i already
mentioned what happened to us as the leaders of the unions and what
happened before that i think that these were things that led to the
anger and the oppression of the people they were treated like animals
	there are things that i would like to mention which happened afterwards
we were talking about reconciliation and as a south african i would like
to present this so that there can be reconciliation in this country
there was something happening there were things about the civil claims
of the people who were shot some were working in their homes and they
got shot or they would get beaten they would go the court of law hire
lawyers and their lawyers would get arrested when they were supposed to
appear in court and their case would be dismissed people were forced to
pay huge amounts of money i would like these things to be taken note of
because this happened because of the bus issue
	there are also rumours that there were people who were buried in the
gate at night i would like to ask the commission to try and persuade the
people who were working at the time to come forward to the commission to
tell us what happened at that time if these people would come forward
there would be reconciliation in this country
	what i would like to say about reconciliation in conclusion is that i
would like to part of the people who are trying to bring about
reconciliation what was very painful to us even today is that some of
the people pointed us out at the time the people who were oppressing us
would be promoted after their deeds i would like the government to look
at the promotion policy especially with regard to people such as these
because we don’t understand why they get promoted after what they did
this is our democratic government our transparent government i’m saying
that we should play with our government but it is still very painful to
us when it comes to that issued
	again some us as well as myself would like to get our files from the
special branch there was a file of myself in the special branch units
they said they were following me while i was in cape town durban and
port elizabeth i would like to know why they were investigating me
because i was working for the trade unions at the time i would like to
get that file in all that happened we must realize that people were
sacrificing their lives and sacrificing their work trying to fight for
the liberation as i was reading through the newspapers the perpetrators
in the border region or the eastern cape region are not coming forward
those who were oppressing us and harassing us i think that even though
the truth and reconciliation commission is coming to an end we would
like them to come forward because we know them i would like to give you
an example there is not a single member of the special branch who hit
and kicked me who has come forward to say i’ve done this to cisa i
would like those who were hired by the ciskeians not only the special
branch to come forward to tell us the truth i’m afraid that if they
don’t come forward we will not forgive them
	the companies came here to invest money but because the trade unions
were oppressed the companies were told not to invest their money in the
border area as the trade unions were highly militant we tried to
negotiate this telling them that we would like them to come and invest
their money here that here would be strikes but where the trade unions
were involved they would try to negotiate and resolve the issue we
would like the countries which gave permission to the companies to come
to this country to invest money to come forward and invest their money
because there is poverty in this region if that can happen there would
	again mr chairperson i think the public works programme has a job to do
for those people who lost their jobs because they were fighting for
liberation we are in poverty but we know that we sacrificed our jobs
because we were trying to fight for liberation in the social security
we know that the government does not have enough money but we would like
it to help as some of us were injured because of such incidents these
people were in the struggle and although they were injured they
continued to fight for the liberation
	there was an issue regarding the black listing i remember that
elderly people from robben island could not get jobs and this also
reflected on the workers when a worker organized other workers in the
company trying to fight for their rights they would be seen as an
enemy we want such black lists to be brought forward we would like
the names of those who were black listed to be mentioned because they
were members of the trade unions and we want all the companies and
business people to come forward publicly to clearly state that they will
not use that black list again if a company is found to be using that
black list it would be punished because that black list consisted of
those people who were sacrificing their lives so that we could be
liberated in this country we cannot leave these people alone mr
	let me conclude mr chairperson by saying what i was trying to say was
that the bus boycott of showed the efforts of the government to
destroy people’s lives plans were made concerning people’s lives so that
they were not able to fight for their rights they were oppressed i
would like to say this in english in order for it to be clear the 
bus boycott did expose a conscious effort by the apartheid regime by the
oppressive regime to constantly disrupt people’s lives and enhance their
independence on the apartheid systems undermine their resistance and
undermine their struggle for freedom peace and democracy that is what
the boycott exposed it was not the first boycott in east london it
was not the first boycott in south africa
	there is something i would like to say the presence of the special
branch and the cooperation of the employers with the government was a
very painful thing to us and we have evidence of this mr chairperson i
haven’t heard an employer coming forward to the commission saying that at
the they were cooperating with the special branch or that they were
trying to disrupt and to stop the struggle of the trade unions we would
like them to come forward we can see that they are legally represented
by the people who represented the previous regime i know that there are
people who are going to give evidence here today but i hope that what
i’ve just said has given you a clear picture of what was happening at the
time what i’ve just said will remind people who are here today so that
they are able to come and testify here today and give you a clearer
thank you mr mgikelana we have given you a lot of time and we
wanted to stop you but we couldn’t because you were giving us an overall
context of what was happening at that time here above all i think that
it’s the first time that we’ve received a submission a substantial
submission from the perspective of the trade unions concerning what
happened in this region we thank you for coming here to give us this
perspective we know that there are many leaders who were leaders from
 up until this period who were very militant the leaders who
appeared from but you’ve spoken about what happened in and even
before that that was a very dark period where leadership demanded a
price and we know that you are one of those people in this region those
who sacrificed their lives at a time when it was expensive to do that to
your life and to your family
	we thank you for the background you presented to us and we thank you for
giving us a picture regarding the link between the big businesses and the
government as well as the past regime you answered a question which was
in my mind and that is would there be a full reconciliation if those who
were perpetrators at the time came and clarified this matter to us so
that we can accept what was happening and forgive them you have made a
very clear call at the big business today but if we are going to build
on a solid foundation for the future the past history needs to be
	thank you for the advice you have given us regarding what should be done
and we will forward your advice to the president of this country so that
he can be the one to try or to answer what you have put forward you
spoke to us a leader and as an analyst as well as a patriot we thank
you unfortunately we have given mr ngikelana a lot of time so we will
have a short break of fifteen minutes and we’ll come back here at a
mr chairperson may i swear them in i will start with nobantu
thank you mr chairperson they have been properly sworn in
thank you mr chairperson we will start with mrs tshangana
mrs tshangana without going into detail about the background of this
incident because mr ngikelana has already done this you are going to
talk about your husband what is his name
yes he was shot on the fourth of august
before we talk about his shooting could you briefly tell us
about your husband cifi tshangana was he working
yes he worked at botha bus company
would he use a bus to commute
no he would use a train because he came from fort jackson
let’s talk about the day of his shooting what happened
can i hand over to you mrs tshangana to tell us about this
he got up in the morning to go to work we heard the sound
of bullets he went to work and as he was walking in our street he came
across police vans the police accosted them saying that they should not
the police just shot at them and he lost his leg our neighbours called
an ambulance but when it came it was chased away he was put in a car
where there were corpses and taken to hospital
	we did not see him at the time he was admitted to the hospital we were
only able to see him on the third day he had a caste on his leg they
had tried to put the leg together but the leg started to rot and it had
to be amputated after having been shot he’d been beaten whilst he was
lying down some men came and beat him up and his forehead caved in they
	he was then released from hospital after staying in the hospital for
about three months i had a one year old child and i then had to go and
look for a job because nobody was working i got a job and as we were
working we were arrested by the south african government of the day i
paid money to an attorney clark who was helping us but i could not
afford to continue paying people came to take our furniture in order to
what workers are you talking about are you talking about sawu
could you please go over this again you say that you were
arrested by whom were you arrested by the government of the day because
was this as a result of your present charges against the
government for having shot your husband
did you have a legal representative
yes but pringle ended up handling our case pringle then
said we must pay what the government is requiring us to pay and they
would give us the money back
you say that something happened in 
he started suffering from diarrhoea there was nothing
wrong with him but he would just mess himself up
the men who beat him up after he had been shot was it the
it was not the police it was the lindikaia group
were these the people who would torture people and the
government would do nothing about it
were the soldiers and the police there
it is the soldiers that shot the people
your legal representative mr pringle what did he say the
results of the entire case were
he said that it was too late and the ciskeian government
did not have enough financial resources to help us
did you start paying off the ciskeian government as they
i only paid twice i paid fifteen rand twice maybe it was
you would pay fifteen rand a week
yes i would pay fifteen rand a week
as mr ngikelana was giving us the political background at the
time he referred to people’s salaries that were very low at the time if
you do not mind i would like to know how much you were earning at the
time of you paying the ciskeian government fifteen rand a week
i was earning fourteen rand a week
and you had to pay fifteen rand to the ciskeian government a
my copanelists would like to know something you say that you
earned fourteen after you paid this fifteen rand
no i was earning fourteen rand a week and i would have to
pay fifteen rand at the attorney’s office
i earned weekly they required me to pay weekly as well
but i could only pay every two weeks
you did not earn enough to pay the fifteen rand weekly
is that all ma’am before i ask if you have any requests before
the truth commission you spoke of children who are at school how many
there’s three of them two have passed matric and the one
is at border tech i cannot afford to send the other to a tertiary
do you have a request in connection with these children
if i could b helped to educate these children because i
suffer from high blood pressure i had a stroke and i have a heart
according to your statement mrs tshangana you say this
incident of people being shot as a result of the bus boycott you request
in your statement that we should investigate this matter again in order
to find out who it was that not only shot him but beat him up as well
if you have any further requests ma’am you can speak after the
miss xofa miss xofa according to your statement the incident
that you are here for is very similar to the previous witness the
difference is that you are going to talk about yourself could you please
tell us what happened when you were shot
i usually woke up at four o’clock in the morning and caught
the first train as we were going to the train that particular morning
the police said that we should go and board the bus instead when were
going back i saw that there was a lot of people standing around looking
towards us and there was a lot of noise it was a bit dark because it was
winter we heard someone blowing a whistle then the shooting started i
tried to go back and as i was walking back my leg started to burn and i
was sure it was bullet there were men standing around and they helped me
home when i got home my husband took me to hospital i was illtreated
at the hospital there was an indian doctor who was treating me and there
was a bullet that was on the surface and it was burning me this man just
pushed the bullet back into me
	the following day i had to go into theatre to be operated on i thought
i was going to die in theatre as i had been illtreated the previous day
they could not remove the bullet so they left it in my body workers
organized money for me to be transported to cape town for a further
examination even in the cape town hospital i was told that the bullet
were you not treated after that
i was discharged from the hospital and i didn’t go for further
you say you had a baby when this happened how old was the baby
i was still breastfeeding at the time
my baby was three months old
who was looking after your baby when you were going in and out
my mother was there to help
did you go to any attorneys
we were told by sawu that there were doctors at the city hall
we went and gave statements and then we went to pringle bax partnership
they would call us in now and again and it was clear that the case was
not proceeding or going anywhere then i got a letter from clarke saying
that i have to pay in some money i realized that i could not pay this
money off because i was not working and nor was my husband after a few
months i was arrested and detained for a week i was then released on a
bail of one thousand three hundred rand which was paid by my younger
i was arrested because i laid charges against the police
you stayed in for five days
so you were out on bail for one thousand three hundred rand
and your sister paid for you
do you not think it an enigma that somebody was shot going to
work in a train gets shot and when this same person who was the victim
of the shooting opens a case with the legal representatives has to pay
is that all the evidence that you have miss xofa do you have
any requests in connection with this incident
what i wish to for is that the perpetrators come forward
because we were being shot because the bus fare was increased by five
no when my leg starts aching i just take tablets
thank you miss xofa if you have forgotten anything from your
statement maybe you can speak later
mr mhlanga mr mhlanga on this particular day you were also
yes i’m one of the victims who was shot on the third of
please tell us mr mhlanga what happened to you at the time of
as a person who was using a half past four train i would be
on the platform at about a quarter past four on this particular day when
i came from the nu i heard an unusual noise when i was on my way on
a tarred road near the nu facing agt i met people who were going to
the train and i heard that there was a rumour that the police are trying
to stop us i didn’t know these people’s names but they were people who
used to go the train at the same time as myself there was no bridge near
the station at the time and we would go to the other side by foot as we
were going to board a train to east london when i looked towards the
station there were cars in front of us and we could hear that there were
gun shots being fired everywhere there was a fence near the station and
because we told ourselves even though there were gunshots we better go
and get shot near the station there were no lights at that time it was
dark i thought that there was someone next to me but when we got to the
station and waited for the train someone told me that i’m wet and when
he tried to look at the place i saw blood i think we were six men at
the time we then felt that there was something inside our bodies i was
shot in my left arm but fortunately the bullet penetrated between the
muscle and the bone this did not affect my bones but it affected my
muscles the other one was shot in the thigh and the other one in the leg
	we were then taken and an ambulance was called to take us to the
hospital the railway soldiers came and they were the ones who called the
ambulance from east london as we were on the other side of the railway
station it was said were in the land of the republic of south africa
and those who were on the other side were said to be the ciskeian people
the soldiers from east london called an ambulance to take us to east
london we were taken to the frere hospital i stayed there for a week
	i then went back to work the workers advised me to go to a lawyer in
highway a mr sewisa to give a statement
excuse me mr mhlanga before going to the case of the lawyer
for how long did you stay in hospital
when i was discharged after that one week i was told to go
back for an operation i then went back for an operation and i stayed in
you went to meet with the lawyer in highway
yes i went to highway to meet with an attorney and gave my
statement and then left after i was discharged from frere hospital i
heard that we had to go and meet with the lawyers again when i got
there they told me that my lawyer was no longer there and they had no
documents on my case i tried to investigate because they said that he
was working with mr mark rabe at that time but my name did not appear on
the list of mr mark rabe that was the end of my case with an attorney
there was nothing more as didn’t know who to consult because there were
no documents or statements and my lawyer was not there i was told that
documents were then given to mr mark rabe but my name was not there
mr mhlanga let me ask you again about your arm you said that
your arm got injured and as a result of that you cannot do certain things
with your arm can you please elaborate on that what were the thing you
used to do with your arm which you cannot do now because of the injury
as a person who was working at a certain workshop we had to
lift heavy equipment but today i cannot lift any heavy equipment because
of the injury i had to get help from someone else i used to love my job
but because of this i could not do the same things
as a father at home you cannot do certain jobs can you cannot
i can lift a chair with my two arms but if i try to lift the
chair with my injured arm i feel pain
you made some requests mr mahlanga at the time you gave your
statement do you still remember your requests
i don’t whether i can remember them clearly but i would like
to say that there were people who helped those who were shot but i never
got any help i don’t know whether they did not see me as an injured
person i heard that there were people who were helped but i was not one
would you like to be compensated
yes if something like that can be done i would like it to
be done because it happened to those who were shot at that time i’m not
saying that if it is not possible i would complain as a person i’m not
expecting compensation but if something can be done i would appreciate
thank you mr mhlanga i will now hand over to the chairperson
mr mhlanga you heard ciso ngikelana speaking earlier about
businesses and my question to you is very specific it’s about the work
that you were doing and where you were working you mentioned a workshop
what kind of workshop was that
i was working for johnson and johnson and it was my second
year with them there was a coal boiler and we working in this section of
coals we would take a trolley full of coal and throw it in a certain
place this is when i found out that i had difficulty although this
might happen after an hour as a person working eight hours a day i would
feel pain when i was trying to lift these coals
mr mhlanga i would like to ask you as well what happened as
far as your injury was concerned how did the firm handle that what was
i don’t have a complaint concerning the company which i was
working for the sister that was there at the time said that my sick
leave days are finished there was one lady who was a social worker i
don’t know whether it was because she was black but she tried to help me
to get paid although my sick leave days were finished because i was still
staying in the hospital i got my money my employers paid me while i was
did you resign or did they ask you to leave
i did not resign but in there were certain people who
were chosen those who worked for the company for less than five years i
could i speak to miss xofa now please miss xofa can you
i want to ask you the same question that i asked mr mhlanga
did you hear it in english or not the question was what was the name of
the firm or where were you working when this incident happened to you
i worked for johnson and johnson we worked together
how was the matter dealt with with yourself
was it after the same period of time the same as mr
we lost our jobs together in 
how long had you worked there
mrs eunice xofa you talked about an amount of one thousand
three hundred that you had to pay for bail for having laid charges
against the government what was this money all about
they said that we’d laid charges against the government we
got a document from mr clarke an attorney to inform us about this
so he’s the one who can inform us better on this money issue
did your legal representatives do anything about this
no they said they did not know what it was all about
did they stand against this as legal representatives
no because i was arrested at the end of it all
even with you mrs tshangana it’s the same story you would
pay your money at mr clarke’s office
we’d have to question him about this matter do you have
mr fuseli has my receipts he was going to a meeting in
johannesburg i went to him to ask for them and he said he does not have
them anymore but i do have a copy of a letter that i’d taken to mr
could you furnish us with a copy of this letter
yes it is with the truth and reconciliation offices in town
i thank the three of you you may step down
we’ll now call thembakazi tuku to come forward
are you wanting me to speak in english to you
then i can take these off and that will be nice you’re here
this afternoon to speak about your brother thembisile and to tell us
what happened to him when he went into exile i’m going to let you tell
your story uninterrupted but before you do that just let me get it quite
clear that he went into exile in ‘ into botswana is that correct
would you like to just carry on and tell us the story please
in the anc sent us a ticket to botswana for my aunt and
myself when we arrived in botswana on a friday afternoon we were told
that somebody from exile was going to meet us but we didn’t see anybody
can i just interrupt you i actually think it’s going to be
easier for you if you speak in xhosa do you mind if you start again
because i would like everybody to hear and i can perfectly all right
alright in we received tickets from the border council
of churches because we requested to go to my brother’s grave we left on
a thursday evening and got to johannesburg where we were going to take a
flight on the friday morning to botswana we had been promised that there
would be people who would meet us at the airport however there was nobody
	we tried to phone the anc headquarters and told them that nobody had
come to meet us at the airport and we requested help they said that
they’d sent two people from lusaka but these two people had been arrested
by the botswana security branch because they had no visas and were told
to go back to lusaka they then said they would phone somebody from
botswana to organise accommodation for us and we went to a motel this
man said he was scared because the anc had been banned in botswana this
person said he would organise a lady from botswana a lady that my
brother and his girlfriend had been staying with it was these people who
were going to take us to my brother’s grave but nobody came the whole of
friday and on saturday morning we phoned lusaka again asking for help we
needed direction and we had no money it was the anc that promised that
everything would be organised my aunt knew somebody who lent her some
money and we tried to buy some food at the motel
	late on saturday anc men who were in the underground structure came to
us and told us to wait for a lady that was going to come and tell us
everything i said that i didn’t even want to know what happened all i
wanted was to see my brother’s grave the report then was that if the
botswana police found out that we were anc people our lives would be in
danger sunday morning i phoned lusaka and they told us that comrade
chowa was on his way from lusaka he apparently used public transport to
come down sunday evening these people arrived chris was his name
	the following morning we were supposed to go with them to the grave i
begged them for information and the one tried to tell me that comrade
thembisile died in a way that they too could not explain they said they
found him in his room and he’d already passed away his gun was in his
hand and he was under a mattress what shocked them about the situation
was that nobody was allowed to go to his funeral except for three people
who were allowed to attend the priest his landlady and his girlfriend
all i wanted was to go to the graveyard
	late on monday chowa who was an exile phoned he was in the botswana sun
hotel and he came to our motel and told us that he arrived in botswana on
the sunday the police arrested him and interrogated him with regard to
our presence in botswana as well as his presence we thanked chowa and
came back to south africa on the tuesday not having found anything about
my brother and not having seen his grave
thank you i need to ask you a few questions now lets go
right back to the beginning he was resident here in east london before
he went to botswana is that right
you say that when he was found in his room you were told
that he was already dead he was under a mattress and he had his gun in
his hand who was it that gave you that information
it was one of the comrades who were there
somebody victor is that his surname or is it a first name
were there wounds on the body or was he just holding his
gun was he shot or was he just 
you don’t know about that so you’re then saying that the
funeral took place and even now you have not been told where the grave
is when last did you approach the anc for help when you went up there
it was in have you been back to the anc since
i didn’t go back to the anc
in your statement and in your requests you actually say that
if the body was ever buried in botswana you seem uncertain as to whether
body was actually buried there is that correct are you uncertain about
i’m uncertain about it because i didn’t see the grave
you might have heard us earlier speaking about the second
submission of the anc to the trc in which a public commitment was made
that records of circumstances like this that people are unsure about
they are prepared to assist us with information and so all we can say to
you now having heard your story is that we will look at those records and
see if more can be found out is there a particular request that you have
to the commission other than the fact that you want to know where he was
buried and that you would like his body to be brought back
how old was he when he left
he was about thirty five years
did he leave dependants behind children
and there were no children in botswana that you know about
thank you i’ll hand you back to the chairperson
thembakazi i would just like to clarify the issue of
thembisile being shot under mysterious circumstances according to your
statement in his flat in botswana if we are going to successfully
investigate this matter please tell us what do you suspect happened to
we think that he was shot because it does not make sense that
somebody would be found under a mattress with a gun and that person and
that person committed suicide we would like to know what happened
are there any rumours that he perhaps was shot by people from
therefore you have no knowledge of what happened to him at all
no after we received a telegram from lusaka mr mzamu of the
special branch wanted to find out where the telegram was and the contents
of the telegram because he said the anc was cruel filthy and it does not
care about it’s people we only received the telegram quite a while after
thembisile had died and after he died the anc did nothing there was no
compensation and no financial support whatsoever
i think you endeavoured to find out what happened after the
anc was banned did you try
any particular reasons why you didn’t or didn’t you think that
you said only the priest the landlady and the girlfriend were
at the funeral did you ever talk to this lady
do you know where they are
thembakazi i will thank you together with those that are
going to give their evidence just now please step down
our next witness is knosinathi gontshi it looks as if
knosinathi gontshi is not here so could we call francina wheeler
francina wheeler will you stand to take the oath
thank you mr chairperson good morning francina you are
here today to tell us about your husband boyce michael and his death on
this day on the first of may ‘ is that correct
how are you feeling are you feeling relaxed
nervous well just relax and i’m going to ask you one
question before you start and then i’d like you to go through you story
i see you have a statement there do you that you’d like to read
the question i want to ask you relates to something that
is in your statement which i’d like to clarify how did you hear about
through his friend that was with him
i see because in the statement it says something
different will you continue now and tell us exactly was happened
my children and i were at home watching videos and my
husband had gone to the high gate for the first time one o’clock came
and the children had gone to bed so i went to bed i was fast asleep when
i heard banging on my door so i got up thinking it was my husband who had
lost his key i opened the door and saw my husband’s friend who had gone
with him to the high gate and he asked if he could come in i opened up
and we went through to the lounge and sat down i knew something was
wrong he said to me dave is gone and i didn’t understand and when he
said dave is dead i apparently fainted when i came around he told me
what had happened he said they were sitting having a drink and their
backs were facing the door they heard like fire crackers and apparently
my husband still said someone is happy they are shooting fire crackers
just then they burst in and started shooting my husband saved my
friend’s life because he was sitting next to her and he pushed her down
on the floor and that’s when he was shot he died instantly
	for two weeks i was on tranquilisers and i didn’t know what was going
on people came to see me but i cannot remember who came from then on we
suffered i lost my car because i could not afford to pay it as my
husband used to pay it i couldn’t afford the rent so i had to sell some
of my furniture and move in with my father who had a small house my
children suffered at school their marks were down as they were out of
school for two weeks and they are still very bitter
alright some questions to you what was the age of your
he was working at grosvenor ford
were you assisted by the firm after his death
you’ve spoken about the effect on you from an economical
point of view but how has it affected you emotionally
i’m still very bitter and upset because of what we’ve had to
go through and what we’ve lost
in terms of treatment for that have you had any
psychological treatment any care in that respect
was your husband on a medical aid
yes but the day he was killed the medical aid fell away
so he wasn’t on any kind of pension scheme at work either
you’ve heard the other witnesses from that event being
asked questions about their attitude and you’ve said that you’re bitter
but just as they were asked i would like to ask you too what your feeling
would be about being faced with the perpetrator asking for forgiveness
for what they did how would you feel about that
you wouldn’t want to either receive a request such as that
i wouldn’t like to see them i wouldn’t like to come face to
are you feeling the same way as the other witnesses about
would you like to just explain what you’re feeling
i think that those who were involved should actually be
so you’re not happy about the amnesty process not for
it doesn’t matter what colour you are everybody must pay for
what are your expectations from the commission mrs wheeler
i would like financial help for myself and my children
would you like to explain what kind of financial help in
are you working at the moment
yes i’m starting work on the first of july i’ve been out
of work since october last year
as a result of the effects this has had on you
oh i see so you are actually starting another job
i’m glad about that is there anything else you would like
to say mrs wheeler to the nation because you are speaking to the nation
i just hope there’s going to peace in the world amongst all
do you have that hope that there will be
yes i’m sure that there will be
thank you very much i’m going to hand you back to the
i wanted to say a word of thanks to all the people who have
testified from the high gate massacre but i see that others have already
left the room we are talking about a tragic event and i think we all
have sensed the pain and a lot of anger which has come out in the hearing
of this matter this morning we are dealing with an event which has been
roundly condemned as a brutal act of senseless violence and i think a
number of people in this region and throughout the country have condemned
it as such and what has been very difficult to come to terms with is the
fact that the event happened at the time when negotiations were taking
place for a peaceful transformation of this country so we are dealing
with an event which causes a lot of pain and indeed we have heard this
morning how much bitterness and anger there is from those who testified
to us i want to say just for the sake of the record that the apla
command has made a request to the commission that they would like to have
a meeting with the victims and that is why we have been raising the
question constantly about how those who have testified today feel about
meeting the perpetrators the apla command has requested us to facilitate
such a meeting because they believe that having done what they have done
they would like to meet with the victims in a spirit of reconciliation
we will pursue that discussion from what we have heard here today it is
not going to be a very easy decision the pain and the bitterness has
been made evident in the testimonies that we have listened to but we are
committed to a spirit of reconciliation and our task will be to continue
to knock on your doors and even after our time has ended i’m sure there
will be somebody who will continue this process because it looks to me as
if there is no alternative the country has no alternative we either come
to terms with the ugly past in which we have inflicted pain on each other
in various ways and begin to say to each other we are sorry and those who
have been hurt to begin to say we forgive you it’s going to be a very
difficult route judging by the testimonies that we’ve heard this morning
we are extremely happy that you have come and we are pleased that you
have spoken so frankly and so openly and i think that it’s brilliant that
it has happened here in mdantsane that we hear you rather than anywhere
else these are two communities which have suffered tremendously
	yesterday we were at the eggerton station where we were listening and
hearing the stories of the pain of people who were brutally killed in a
senseless act of violence which in many ways is similar to this one
people were going to work and they were forced not to board the train
which they usually used for their transport forced to go into buses we
heard a story of a mother who was sitting at home doing her washing and
was hit by a stray bullet which messed up her life these are stories of
pain and i would hope that somehow this country finds a way in which
those who have done these things own up to what they have done and begin
to say they are sorry and how by god’s grace perhaps it possible for
those who have experienced extreme pain and continue to suffer the
anguish like the gentleman who was here this morning who continues to
suffer the consequences in his own body of what has happened perhaps to
find the grace to say for the sake of the future of this country we are
prepared to forgive we thank you very much
	we will be taking an adjournment and we will be going to high gate this
morning to go and just remember what happened there thank you if we can
adjourn for lunch right now and the victims can go straight to lunch
we’ll start again at one thirty thank you
we will now call bernice whitfield
welcome bernice whitfield tiny maya will raise a few questions
to you with regard to your statement
thank you mr chairman before we start i need some assistance
with this blind as i’m not able to see her properly i need to have this
moved aside thank you good morning mrs whitfield i see that the
testimony that you’re going to give this morning is about your husband
deric john whitfield is that correct
according to the statement in front of us your husband was
only forty two years old when he was killed in the shooting that took
place at high gate hotel is that correct
i want to give you an opportunity to present your testimony
uninterrupted and then maybe i will come back to ask you a few question
just to clarify things that may not be clear you can continue
at the time of the shooting we were staying in vincent
gardens north and when i came to hear about the shooting i was totally
devastated knowing that i had to bear the financial situation myself the
rental we paid there was r which i was unable to afford with the
death of my husband i got r out of my salary as i wasn’t being paid
correctly for my qualifications i couldn’t pay for the funeral my
motherinlaw paid all the costs to this day i haven’t been able to pay
her back i had to change jobs because as i said financially i could not
cope i had three children at that stage
	ten months after my husband was killed my daughter was killed in a car
accident the guy had no licence and he was speeding and drunk he was
fined r that was what her life cost he got off scott free which
tells me in this world there’s no justice in that the people were killed
at the high gate didn’t have to die they weren’t ill they weren’t sick
i managed to get the cheapest flat in baysville which was seven hundred
rand at the time which i could not afford either but it was better than
sitting somewhere where there was no place to stay with three children
in the end that building was sold and i had to move again just bear in
mind that the first time i had seven hundred rand plus seven hundred rand
maintenance deposit plus lights and water which was five hundred and
something rand at that stage it came to over a thousand rand which i had
to have spot on to move into baysville from the house then i had to find
another flat because the building was sold so i had to make another loan
for the next lot of maintenance deposit lights and water etc
	i didn’t have any food or money the red cross and god bless them were
the only people who phoned me and said we have a food parcel for you
because i didn’t even have a slice of bead they had a food parcel for me
and six hundred rand and one day when i’m on my feet i want to bless
somebody to give them something to bless somebody who’s in need because
i was very grateful for that
	as i say in the daily dispatch i read that one of the guys and his
picture was in the paper that was responsible for the killing at the
high gate got fourteen years suspended for thirteen years what kind of
justice is that if anybody steals a loaf of bread in a shop because he’s
hungry he gets three months jail sentence or doesn’t even get out there
but if you rape murder and kill you get a two rand fine and you walk
scott free and enjoy the facilities of life i just say to myself the
renegades that were responsible for various attacks are being paid by the
government at the moment they’re sitting in high positions like big
heroes and we’ve got to face a financial battle
	why do we waste our time in listening to what everybody has to say and
opening up our wounds here nobody feels anything for us i’m speaking
for all races not because i’m white and this one is pink yellow and
green i’m speaking for all of us there’s a lot of people that are in
the same position that i find myself in let us just take the king
william’s town golf club the guy who’s responsible there for the killing
is sitting in a fantastic position today earning money mr so and so
from mc goo’s bar who was responsible for that disaster is sitting in a
high position in the government sector and after all this i say to myself
you’ve got to be a criminal to get ahead in life all these renegades
who’ve completed their murders and brutal violence are being looked after
in high positions in the government earning fat salaries and we the
victims sit with a financial battle to make ends meet the truth
commission too i’m sure you get compensated for what you are doing it’s
been four years now but has anybody asked me do you need a loaf of bread
no if i look at all the victims sitting here from the high gate and
everybody that i’ve seen on tv that has come to testify and nobody has
done anything you’ve only got the lord to look up to and i say the human
race hasn’t done anything for you but god has looked after you god has
	at the moment my daughter has been chosen to go overseas to represent
south africa in the united kingdom and i need r but i trust in god
for he has provided for me up to now and he will provide for us when she
leaves in november must you be a criminal to get to the top do people
like us have to pay the price where our families get brutally murdered
for the sake of political power what power have we got what power has
any political party got or any ordinary man in the street god create us
and this is the word that god has given me because i prayed i don’t want
to be here because i’m wasting my time but i’m here for god i’m
representing him here today and this is the word he gave me god created
us he gives us his power and wisdom to do his will god is love and
anyone walking in the spirit of love has the qualities of the spirit
which is love kindness compassion and understanding when you look at
the world today where people go about killing murdering and raping for
the sake of recognition and status be it for political reasons or
whatever then the truth about them is that they walk in darkness for the
evil one is a destructive force for if they walked in the spirit of god
some only has the name of jesus on their lips if you genuinely have
god’s love in your heart you would demonstrate the spiritual qualities
which is love kindness compassion and understanding and striving for
inner peace and peace goodwill to all man you have no power nothing on
earth belongs to us it is all on loan for the earth is the lord’s and all
that is in it the things on earth are given to us to enjoy to choose
between right or wrong you might be a man or a woman in a high position
with all the authority you can have but the day you fall down and die
where is your power you have no power where is your wisdom when you
walk in darkness you have no wisdom you act like a fool god has eternal
power and he has the last say my one and only hope is in the lord who is
the only ruler of this world and the only one who has power when he will
come in all his glory to judge the world there might be no justice on
earth people get away with deceitfulness brutality to human beings and
they just walk away without justice being done but one day when you meet
jesus face to face you will have to stand and answer and god will ask of
you not how you won but how did you play the game don’t be trapped in a
sick society where true morals and standards and values get thrown by the
wayside for the sake of status and power for you have no power we can
only have power in god and as an ordinary person an ordinary man in the
street i want to say to all of you today that god wants us to focus on
him two wrongs don’t make a right have peace god’s peace do good to
mankind help your friends we are all god’s people irrespective of who
or what you are and the holy spirit will come down on each and every one
and all the nations must look up to jesus because if you know god’s love
how can you hurt the person next door to you that is all i have to say
thank you mrs whitfield i would like to ask you just a few
questions as i said earlier it is obvious that the death of your husband
has affected you has changed your life and the life of your family and
i would you to share with us the effect that his death has had
on you and especially your children and also tell us how many children
you have their ages and whether they are schooling or not
okay i’ve got a daughter in standard eight she’s
fifteen natalie and i’ve actually applied for assistance with school
fees i’ve got to pay one thousand nine hundred rand and they gave me two
hundred i stand to correction i think it’s two hundred discount that
they give me which doesn’t actually make a difference because i might as
well pay the whole amount i’ve got to see to all her schooling her
clothes etc she’s doing drummies which is a very costly sport but i feel
i cannot deprive her from that my son has been unemployed for a while
and i’m supporting him as well he’s looking for a job but you can’t just
find a job i myself i work and i will have to work until the day i die
because i need money i’m staying in southern wood which is not an area i
would like to stay in i would like to stay in a clean flat as my flat is
very dilapidated it’s got holes in the kitchen and the taps don’t work
coming from a place where i lived comfortably i i don’t know i just
had to give up a lot of comfort and easy going living if you know what i
mean i don’t want to be rich as money doesn’t mean anything to me but i
would like to be more comfortable
thank you you said something earlier about seeing a report in
the daily dispatch that one of the people involved in this shooting had
been sentenced to fourteen year imprisonment
yes fourteen years suspended for thirteen years they had
a picture of the gentleman in the paper and they said that they managed
to catch this guy and it was a black gentleman and they said that he got
fourteen years suspended for thirteen years i just tore the paper up and
i said you know this is justice and i’m not even interested
does that mean that you don’t have details that you can give
us so that we can follow the matter up
no i haven’t that is all i saw in the paper and other
than that i don’t know anything what happened to the rest or what is
happening i just thought the whole story died down and we go onto the
mrs whitfield if you were to come face to face to this person
or if you were given an opportunity to convey a certain message to him or
to them what would you like to convey to them
as the lord said to me when he gave me this word he can
walk away from us with the deeds that he’s done but one day when he comes
face to face with jesus he will have to answer because when the lord
deals with you it hurts if i deal with him he won’t feel anything and
thank you are you able to tell us at all what the nature and
the extent of injuries your husband sustained in the shooting
i think it was either three or four bullet wounds in the
chest he was alive for a while but he drowned in his own blood that’s
thank you would you like to place a request or a
recommendation before us so that we can convey that to the state
as i said before in east london nothing has been done and
nothing will be done and i really don’t expect anything to be done
mrs whitfield would you like maybe to request an indulgence
just for your children if not for yourself their education their
i actually expected financial help but as i said it’s been
four years and nothing has been done so that is why i say nothing will be
done because there’s nobody that does anything for us it’s been four
years and we’ve coped on our own we had to take on the financial battle
ourselves financial assistance would be appreciated very much so but
that also depends on the human hearts of the world
thank you very much i’m going to hand you back to the
chairperson but there could be other questions from the rest of the
thank you mr chairman mrs whitfield i may be asking you the
same question but maybe in a different way i don’t seem to get your
attitude too clearly as to how you would relate to those who perpetrated
this gross human rights violation let us suppose the people who did this
to your husband and other victims of the tragedy were to come to you and
say to you they are asking for forgiveness how would you respond to such
i’ve got no grudge against anybody i feel if i have then i
cannot call myself a child of god because if god forgives us we can
forgive others i cannot judge the man jesus is going to judge him
although it takes forty years forty years is like a wink of an eye to
the lord and he will have to come face to face with jesus his judge and
what happens to him then is between him and the lord he’ll have to
answer then here on earth there is no justice i’ve never seen justice
in this world but when he comes face to face with the lord that is the
day he is going to get judged and that is my only hope
thank you very much mrs whitfield thank you mr chairman
reverend xundu okay the question is withdrawn just one
question from me mrs whitfield you have painted a very gloomy picture of
our future and even your coming to the commission has been put in a
context which has a lot of pain and doubt about the validity of doing
that and i’ve got very serious respect for that in that you have been
honest you have been forthright in talking to us and that is very
helpful it reminds us that we are a truth commission and if people come
to us in truth although it may be painful to listen to that truth but
it’s also very helpful i’ve got one question for you do you have any
hope at all for the future of this country
yes i do have a lot of hope and because i don’t put my
hope in people i put my hope in the lord i see a lot of hope in the
world as i said if we focus on god because it’s only god that can give
you inner peace you know i help and encourage so many people who come
to me with broken heart and i say to them the world might reject you but
jesus will always love you and you know that gives us so much hope if
nobody on earth treats us fair or treats us with respect or what we
deserve and we’ve never seen jesus you feel that love flowing through
from above to you you don’t find that in the human race so if we treat
each and every person with the love of god there will be peace there can
be nothing but peace and nothing but mutual friendships and
relationships this is what i believe in end of tape as far as i’m
concerned i’m wasting my time i’m here for jesus as i said to june
crichton when she phoned me i said i’m not interested in coming here
because you don’t get anywhere here you won’t get anywhere here but i’m
here because god has told me to beme here and say these words to
thank you very much we will call our next witness and convey
our thanks to all of you together
how old are you mr jawe
you look pretty young i thought you were because people
under the age of do not appear before the commission on their own
reverend xundu will swear you in
thank you mr chairperson shepherd lulamile jawe please get up
thank you mr chairperson good afternoon lulamile you are going
to talk about yourself an incident in when you were ten years old
did you know what was happening at the time
it was on the th of september
it was on the th of september we were in the village
singing songs liberation songs we were singing moving down the streets
it was at about nine in the evening as we were singing the police came
with torches and there was teargas and we were shot with rubber bullets
when we heard that we were being shot with rubber bullets and
that there was teargas we ran away jumping over fences as i was
running jumping over a fence i fell
as i was jumping over the fence because it was at night i
fell the police got me some people as they were running would trample
over me i was beaten with the back of a rifle on my head i became
unconscious the next thing i knew i was at cecilia makiwane

education but i cannot because i was gravely affected mentally if the
commission could help me and perhaps some form of compensation for myself

well i do not know perhaps he can be able to identify these
mr jawe you stay at lenge
do you know the police at lenge
there is one ciskeian police in lenge
mr mafu but at that time he was not a policeman yet

the said that the police had taken him i went to the police station

i went to the hospital it was at frere hospital i found out then that
he was there at the hospital after that the sister went to visit at
frere and found him there i was asked to go and sign some documents
because he was going to be transferred to cape town he was shot at the
side he was going to be taken to cape town i went and signed the
documents he came back from cape town in june the same year he could
not do anything for himself he was paralyzed he cannot do anything for
himself the police came and fetched him he was asked to come to court
to appear in court both with the other kids 
excuse me ma’am why was he shot do you know 
was he a member of a political organization 
were there problems at school at the time do you remember 
there were no problems i think the other child would tell a
therefore you never got details as to why your child was shot
but do you know who shot him 
he was shot by a policeman
do you know which policeman is this 
did you give in a statement or was lokhwe charged 
i went to an attorney my witness is here this attorney
represented this child and they were innocent
what is he using now what was he using went he went to the to
so you don’t know what the case was all about 
we will ask for the witness’s name what is his name 
we will talk to him therefore ma’am the fact that your son
was injured there was no case about that
would you do you have any requests 
my child is still at school i’m on pension i suffer from
masibonge eventually passed away what happened 
he used his wheelchair for four years after that as he was
paralyzed his bottom started rotting his knees started protruding the
he was sent to frere hospital and they amputated him and he passed away
i have a child at school
how old when was he born 
was masibonge your oldest eldest child 
no there’s one older than him
he’s your only child at school this one you’re talking about 
yes no i have no other requests
i will hand you over to the chairperson when i’m through with
ma’am how do you pronounce your surname 
mrs mbelekana you’re going to talk about mbulelo archie who was
your son who was shot at komga is that so 
yes he was stabbed on the th of november yes
in your statement you give detail that he was killed by people
who were members of two organizations could you give us the details 
first of all i was at work in tamarah apparently on the
thursday he’d been elected as the anc chairperson on the sunday he was
going to take his position take up his position as the chairperson
apparently at about am on sunday somebody knocked on his window he
got out when he got out there were two doors he used the back door by
the steps he came across these people who stabbed him i was taken from
keimouth and the corps was already taken i was told that they stabbed
him to death and left him to die
do you know who it is that warned him 
was archie a member of political organization or what was the
did you find out who it is that murdered him 
no this is why i’m here i want to know
did you talk to the person who came to warn him
no there were investigators i don’t know what happened
neliswa would you like to add something thank you mr
mbulelo passed away on sunday it was about am when i got
up i went to get some water i stay with my grandmother and aunt a child
asked if i knew that mbulelo had passed away i said no the last time i
had seen him was the previous night when i got to the gate there were a
whole lot of people i asked if it’s true that he’d died young children
answered me and told me that yes he’d passed away and he was left by the
guava tree i went to church my father told me exactly what happened
apparently he’d been with his girlfriend what happened is when the
the girlfriend hid herself under the bed i asked how she’d hidden
herself under the bed because you cannot hide yourself under a double bed
base and i asked why it is that she should hide herself
did she perhaps think that it’s another of his girlfriends 
i said no it’s impossible investigators came pictures
were taken mrs mbelekana came back from keimouth to work back at home
the investigators said that they know who the perpetrators are i
asked why they are not arresting anyone this investigator then said
they investigated and said he went to the prosecutor wanting a warrant of
arrest we were hopeful nothing ever came of it to this day
is that all you have to say
mr sithabathaba would you like to add something but apparently
you are the uncle to the deceased when you heard that something had
happened what did you find out 
somebody came and knocked and said mbulelo had passed
away i went and indeed he’d was he’d already passed on
you never found out who it is that murdered him 
in our statement mbulelo was murdered by anc members as he was
going to be the new executive these people together with other members
of yet another organization could you tell us more about this 
on the th of january mr zola an investigator came
told me that he’d gotten the people they were anc members and pac
therefore it is members of the two organizations 
did you hear of any reasons 
no this is what we’d also like to know
was this a norm that when such things would happen these
organizations would come together and attack
i’d never heard of it before
thank you do you have requests to the commission 
first of all i request that the case be investigated and
i want to know who killed mbulelo he’s he was my only child the father
died in secondly mbulelo passed away i’m alone i need a house to
no there’s a ten year old who’s my grandniece from
thank you i’ll hand you over to the chairperson
i thank you all for telling us about these incidents we
know komga velly very well especially in connection with battles that
took place there even though it is difficult for you to be comforted
however a lot of work was done in komga and around the border region we
will look closely at your requests if it was up to us we would meet all
these needs but we depend on the president to see what he can do but in
the meantime we thank you please step down
thank you you may sit down we welcome you mrs thabi
ngange we apologize for mispronouncing your name
the people who wrote our statement made that mistake
please put on earphones because you will be asked in english
are you hearing me now mrs ngange you can speak xhosa
inisi xhondo you spoke about the pain that this country has
experienced and especially this area and you have come to tell us about
the pain of the incident that happened in your family to your sister and
to your mother now first of all would you tell me where you living at
home at the time that this happened 
we were coming from work we were working for kenny we were
coming from work at about half past five when we were about to arrive at
saw a lot of people in the corner we went into our yard our home’s
yard we saw my mother and my father and children outside i saw goodman
amongst the people who were there i saw boyi xhoshini xnuxnu was one of
the people who were there they told us to leave together with my
mother it was myself funeka my mother and nogxnena we went to komga
they surrounded us telling us to tell them the truth we asked the the
truth about what they said we know we told them we don’t know
anything one woman by the name of nolifisi came nolifisi said that they
went to a witchdoctor and it was found that my mother was killing
nolifisi’s brother she was bewitching nolifisi’s brother my mother said
that i had to be taken alone they asked me why we were not getting
married at home they said that funeka and ginesa were divorced they
came home they stayed together with myself and my mother they took us
back noyuepi said that this woman has got to go to a witchdoctor to find
out the truth they said that we were going to pay out this witchdoctor
to bribe her they asked us many questions some we could not answer
there were four tyres next to me together with a litre of petrol it
was myself my mother funeka and zanele
i’m going to nterrupt you now just to ask you a question
so that we can have clarity the man who had died was the man who had
died stwayi was he the one that died and this was the one that you
your mother and sister were being blamed for by the witchdoctor is
now can you tell me what actually happened on that day on
the on the th what actually happened how did it culminate what
please listen ma’am what is your clan name 
mr sandi please listen mamgwevu i have a question for you where there
political organizations in the community udf adm or anc 
there was one organization it was anc
was it a conflict was there a conflict amongst anc members 
this issue is it politically motivated or what 
your mother’s incident and your sister’s incident does this
have to do with any political activity 
this was just a crime against your family a crime from people
who were not disciplined can you hear me 
mr chairperson i will hand over to you i think you’ll be the
one who can forward this case thank you
mrs ngange this is a very difficult case for us but what we
would like to know is that in your statement you said that the people who
necklaced or who killed nomriti and funeka were comrades
what do you mean by saying that they were comrades were
they were people from the anc we were together in this
was there a court case was there a court case ma’am 
yes there was a court case
what was the outcome of the court case 
i did not hear about their sentences but when i was when i
went back home i heard that they were sentenced but i did not hear for
you you were not told for how long were they sentenced 
were they sentenced for life or what 
they were sentenced and then they were released again
i don’t know whether they were they had to pay money but
they were arrested for a while
what is your request mrs ngange to the commission what
would you like the commission to do for you concerning this incident 
funeka’s child is with me i would like funeka’s child to be
supported i don’t have a place to stay because we left everything in
that village we have no place to stay together with funeka’s child i
would like funeka’s child to be educated and i would like to be provided
with a home because we left everything in that village we left with my
father my father died we were staying in a one roomed house at that
time i don’t have a place to stay now because i cannot work i’m
looking after funeka’s children and my two children my father was the
one who was supporting me but now he passed away
would you like some water ma’am lastly you mentioned
tshemese xungxu and others you said that they took part they were
involved in the killing of these two people do you see them now 
goodman tshemese was looked after by my father their father
was working away he was not looking after them but they said that my
mother was a witch and they killed her they were staying in my home my
do you know them do you see them now 
goodman is here there he is
thank you ma’am we will investigate this case as a
commission we work under law we have to look at issues which were
brought by a political conflict if we find out that your case is not
politically was not politically motivated we will tell you to go to the
court of law because we are not here to find out about what happened in
the communities but for now i cannot say whether this falls under our
law or you have to go to a court of law we will investigate and we will
talk to goodman xugxnu we’ll ask them to appear in front of the
commission to answer certain questions for now we would like thank you
you may go back to your seat ma’am
welcome mr redpas you are representing madoda kula
thank you do you want to address us
mr chairperson yes on behalf of the implicated person
madoda kula he has submitted a written statement it is not in affidavit
form to the commission and to the committee and he has in respect of an
unrelated matter made application for amnesty a copy of which is
attached to his written representation of his statement mr chairperson
you will note from the content of that statement it is a short one mr
kula mr madoda kula maintains that he was not present at the incident to
which two witnesses immediately preceding us have testified based on
what i have heard and presumably what you yourself mr chairperson
members of the committee have heard there is no evidence to show that
madoda kula was indeed a member of that group that attacked that house
it was a tragic incident we also are not without emotion we sympathise
with the members of the family however we maintain our innocence in
respect of that particular incident we also wish to point out that two
other persons mentioned in the notification send to us were in fact
according to our knowledge charged with that incident and subsequently
acquitted it is not as has been testified to by the witnesses that the
case was simply withdrawn our knowledge is to the effect that they were
acquitted after due process of law we wish to confirm 
you are referring to mr magodola and mr mati here alright
makaloba it is wrongly spelt you are saying that those two
where charged and a trial held and they were acquitted
that is the extent of our knowledge we cannot present that to
the committee as a fact that is just our knowledge and belief at this
stage as i presume the knowledge and belief of the family was that the
case was simply withdrawn there is a substantial difference
we wish to confirm however this is on behalf of madoda kula
that he was questioned by the police in respect of the incident to which
the witnesses have testified but he was released and he was not charged
for that incident which in itself i present to the committee
corroborates their evidence that they were unable to identify the
perpetrators as eyewitnesses such information which came to hand later
was hearsay second or thirdhand at best and it is upon that basis too
that the submission is made on behalf of madoda kula that he cannot be
implicated at this stage on evidence before the committee in that
	an additional aspect which we wish to highlight and to confirm because
it has been testified to by the two witnesses preceding us is that mr
madoda kula was on the identity parade about which there has been
evidence before this committee and he was not identified at this stage
mr kula we will put you under oath and then just to have you
confirm what your lawyer has just submitted to us could you then 
mr chairperson he has been sworn in
did you listen do you understand english mr kula
you heard advocate redpas take us through your statement and
adding a few things to your written statement do you confirm that to
your knowledge all that has been said is the truth just for us to have
it on record that you have confirmed it
thank you are there any questions ntsiki sandi
thank you mr chairman i just want to start off by asking mr
redpas i see that there is a copy of an amnesty application here do you
want to refer to that the amnesty application that was made by your
client to the amnesty committee do you want to refer to that or would
you have a problem if we refer to the contents of the applicationer
i have no problem with any reference being made to the
contents of that that is after all mr madoda kulas version of the
 is not the incident to which the two witnesses preceding
when was that application for amnesty made
mr chairperson if i could just quickly take instruction on
that does the date not appear on the application itself mr chairperson
it was signed on the ninth and submitted on the tenth
the tenth that was the last day for the submission of
now let us talk about the incident in regard to which your
client had applied for amnesty when did this happen
this is five years later the incident happened in as
you have said and the application is made and submitted on the tenth may
 the last day for the submission of applications for amnesty am i
in everything but one the incident happened seven days after
the incident to which the witnesses before this court testified before
this commission the witnesses testified that the incident happened on
the th of october the incident in respect of which madoda kula
has applied for amnesty happened on the nd which is seven days
otherwise everything that has been put to me is correct
i have heard the contents of the application for amnesty and
it seems to me that the matter in which he had applied for amnesty
appears to be less serious than the one in which he is alleged to have
in this particular amnesty application matter no people were
killed no human being died as the result of the action which he has
is it a coincidence that he should submit an application for
amnesty in regard to a matter in which no people died is it a coincident
and not a matter where some people have died
i am not certain what you mean to convey to me by suggesting
is it not a coincidence the only reason for placing that before this
committee is to distinguish between the two incidents there was one
incident to which madoda kula says i did do it but that is not the
incident for which he has been requested to appear before this committee
and in respect of which the witnesses have testified
the matter in which he has applied for amnesty is a matter or
it is a crime that was committed in alice
is that the same place is it the same locality where the
incident that was referred to by the witness by the two witnesses it
can i ask your client some questions sir
did mr galana speak with you did he ask you about what mr
what did he ask you about
he asked me about the ngece incident
did he not say that there was a certain mr xhanda from king
williams town who was a member of the ciskei
thank you mr chairman a mr galana who is investigating this
case did he speak to you
what did he ask you what did he say to you
he was asking me about the ngece incident
he did not ask you about what mr xhanda said
did he ask you whether you knew mr xhanda
we were working we were working together and i know him from
where were you on this particular day when this incident took
i was at home in stutterheim
did you hear about the incident
yes i heard about it over the radio
what did you hear over the radio
i heard that there were people who died in msobomvu belonging to
i did not believe it because i was not there and i did not see
after you returned to the location did you hear that this
i did not return to the location
do you know the ngece family
yes because we were all staying in the same village
did you have any conflict with them
mr chairperson that is all i wanted to ask for now thank you
thank you mr chairperson mr kula at this time who were you
working for at the time of this incident on the th of october who were
i was working for the ciskei defence force
was it a usual thing for you to go and patrol in the villages
or was it for the first time that this thing happened according to your
can you please repeat your question
as you were listening to the testimony the police used to come
to the houses beating people was it the first time this incident
happened according to your knowledge that the police would go to the
village and beat and assault people
i am not sure because i was not deployed
you mean that you were never involved you were never deployed
at the time of the incident the people who said that they
were anc members were they unbanned at this time
when was the anc unbanned according to your knowledge
i do not know because i am not politically active
what was your duty in the ciskeian defence force
i was in their logistic department
you were not aware of the banned meetings you were not aware
this is not connected to my duty
as a citizen were you not aware that the anc was unbanned
were you not aware that there were negotiations between the anc and the
i could i use to hear this over the radio
as a person who was working for the government you are
supposed to be current concerning the security of the country we want
the truth from you you were protecting the government of ciskei but you
are saying that you were not aware of whether the anc was unbanned do
you want us to believe this
mr chairperson with respect i have been following these
questions they do not seem to be at all relevant to show that madoda
kula may or may not have been at the scene to which the witnesses have
the reason why i ask these questions mr chairperson is to
ascertain and to make sure that the people that were involved in this
matter as soldiers he was also a soldier they would they would go into
the villages beating people up intimidating people i want to ascertain
whether he was part of this or not therefore i am asking questions that
are going to reveal that he is not part of this at all as he says so
therefore on this day you were in stutterheim
you therefore have nothing to do with this incident with the
mr kula you have applied for amnesty for having thrown a
hand grenade on the th of october no nd of october is
this house is not connected to the ngece home at all
do you know how many attacks were in msobomvu at the time
you are not aware and the nd october incident was
just on its own what is the relation between you and the ngece family
i do not stay in that village anymore i do not see them i
sometimes see them in king williams town i have nothing against them
well thank you very much for appearing before us mr kula
and thank you advocate redpas we are not contemplating making a finding
on mr kula now we have notified him that he is going to be mentioned in
the testimony that will be presented to us as the commission we are
still going to make a decision on whether we want to make a finding on
him as a perpetrator or not and if we are at any stage contemplating
making a finding in that record we will duly notify him through
yourselves now that you are representing him and we will then give him a
chance to address us before we make that finding for now we are going to
be going into investigations we will be interested in talking further to
mr galana who seems to have implicated him and investigate and see if we
want to contemplate a finding on him
as the committee pleases mr chairperson

mrs bata i also welcome you you are going to talk about lizo
the late mr bata was your husband is that so 
could you tell us fully what happened to him
it was in on a monday that at about before o’clock
we were watching tv and we heard a sound something was being thrown we
thought my husband got up to peep he opened the door the front door he
did not see anything he closed the door but there was a funny smell
like smoke he then went towards the back to see what was happening as
we were running towards the bedroom we went towards
the bedroom running from the smoke we got into the bedrooms then one of
the children shouted that we should go outside because we are going to
suffocate from the smoke we ran over the fence and we went to our
nextdoor neighbour’s house we did not know what was going on an
ambulance was called and i was taken to hospital i heard at the hospital
the next day that my husband had passed away
were there people mrs bata who were arrested for this 
before this happened were there incidents at home like this 
were there people perhaps from the ciskeian defence force or
ciskeian police force who would come to your house looking for a
the ciskeian soldiers would come looking for xembisi bata but
they would not go to home but to the other house
therefore its a member of the family 
according to your statement you suspect the perpetrators you
would you tell us about these people
do you have reason to suspect the ciskeian soldiers 
could you give us these reasons 
first of all when the bomb was exploding this when the bomb
after the bomb exploded the soldiers were there in the yard
did you get any treatment from the doctor 
i used to go to the doctor in and 
did you have children with mr bata 
my eldest was born in the second born and the and
and my third my last one 
could you tell us how the children were affected by this
incident surely they were affected cause they were quite young when the
how do they feel about the way their father died 
what was your father doing your husband doing 
how long had he been a taxi man 
quite a while more than years
why do you think that the ciskeian defence force killed lizo
i think that it was a mistaken they were looking for xembisi
are these house are their houses next to each other 
where were you staying at the time 
at xue xue xue xue township
is that all the evidence that you have mrs bata 
do you have a request in connection with this incident 
i would like to know the perpetrators who they are
you have a request according to your statement about your
if i could be helped with the children so that they can be
was mr bata politically active did he belong to any political
no he did not belong to any political organization
thank you mrs bata if perhaps there’s something you have left
out maybe it will be revealed as the other panelists ask questions
can you hear me mrs bata 
just one question did you get any legal advice about this
make a statement to the police or approach an attorney 
i gave a statement to the police
did anything happen as a result of that 
there was a investigation but no results came of it
your husband was a member well not a member but he was a
taxi driver for years he belonged to bata was there any assistance
we were not helped at all
mrs bata i just need clarity what was the taxi association
that your husband was a member of 
at the time of the incident mrs bata was there perhaps unrest
with especially the taxi men were they fighting at the time 
you said you reported this at the police who as a policeman
i do not know but it was at zwelitsha police station
did the police come to you to take a statement 
mrs bata we thank you very much we’ll remember this day that you’re
talking about when your husband lizo was shot the commission will look
request that we’ve investigate what the contribution of the police was in
matter as you say according to your statement you say you would like to
know who the perpetrators are so that you can forgive them we trust
that our investigative unit will be able to fulfill this need thank you
for having forward with this statement if there’s more details we need
we will come to you mrs bata thank you for now
first of all i would like to apologize that on monday when
we were meant to give testimony before the commission you were not able
to do so because of a request given to us by mr card whom you had listed
in your statement we’ll hand over to mr sandi to lead evidence
mr chairperson we will start with mr boyi could he come
closer to the mike please mr boyi when i look at this statement before
us you say that in you were illtreated by the police as a member of
the pac mr boyi could you tell us what happened on this particular day
in and who the police were that are the perpetrators
mr chairperson in i was arrested and i was sentenced in
because i was a member of the pac as it was banned at the time
this is why i was arrested in march i was sentenced and i was
came back after years in i stayed in hanga the one day 
policemen came and my boss said i’m being called by these policemen mr
card introduced himself to me e they requested that i get into the car
with them i left we got to king william’s town at the office they
closed me into the car locked me into the car they came back after a
few minutes got into the car they did not tell me where they were
taking me this car was driven toward nchoga it was in the morning when
we came close to the river next to nchoga they stopped the car they got
off the car they asked me if i know umgazi i said that i do not know
him the policeman that was standing next to me took me out of the car
he said that we are not playing games here
	they handcuffed me onto a pole they said that i must tell the truth i
know umgazi who’s got a garage in east london a petrol station i did
not know this mr umgazi they said that he had a petrol station with pan
african motives as its name mr card then shot into the air and said that
if i do not tell the truth i was going to die there they did not beat
me up they they unchained me put me into the car this car was driven
to the supreme court in grahamstown they locked me into the car yet
again they asked if i would recognize mr umgazi if i saw him then i
reiterated that i did not know him they went inside it was the first
time i saw mr umgazi in grahamstown late in the afternoon they took me
home they left they actually left in the evening on the way home they
did not take me home that is my complaint here today it is mr card who
thank you sir you say that this mr card introduced himself to
did he give his full name and his title 
he did not say whether he’s a sergeant or not he just said that
he was mr card and introduced the other two i can’t remember their names
did you hear about him after that 
what did you hear about him 
he was known in east london also this side he used to move
around with xantisebe he would investigate political organizations it
was a long time ago when this incident occurred
would you recognize him if you’d see him 
i don’t know because it was a long time ago
is that all the evidence mr boyi 
do you have requests before the commission 
do you have requests before the commission in connection with
mr chairperson i have no requests this man was doing his job
in your statement you say that you wish to meet him is that so
yes i’d like to see him now that i’m free as well
do you have reasons to request this meeting 
i just want to see him now that i am free and in liberation i
just want to see him and look at him
thank you mr boyi lets continue with mr nongena mr nongena
full names are daniel paulos nongena is that so 
your story is similar to mr boyi’s one where you in the same
organization your incidents happened around the same time and the same
place what happened to you mr nongena on this year
it was in neogo was arrested they were leading us in
our organization we would have meetings in the forest we would try to
make our own weapons to protect ourselves as we’d come to king william’s
town we then came to king william’s town we got to the police station
where the court is now there was a post office we went into the back
door when we got there there were people waiting for us already we got
there and our men that were taken from the village were there the police
started shooting in the air jegexho was shot and my older brother
george nongena we then left town kolegenjo and my elder brother
because they could not move were left behind we heard over the radio
that they were found in king william’s town the next morning on the
th xanti sebe came to the village they arrested us and took us to king
william’s town charle sebe came with hatala donald card was not there
they took us to king william’s town they put us into water in a
it’s a sack they put you into the sack they tie it up and
they throw you into the water then you the water inevitably comes into
your mouth and stomach and stomach would be full of water they take you
out pump you pump out the water and put you back again saying that we
yes they wanted us they were demanding the truth on the
second day they came again took us out of the cell we were taken out
they took they would it was it was like routine they’d take us out
of the cell and into the water there was donald card there xanti
xanti would say that he was going to call donald card for us who was
going to sort us out it was difficult to see him because it was at night
but i would hear them calling out his name donald card
are you referring to xanti xanti charles sebe 
please repeat this you’re saying that what did charles sebe
charles said that card was going to sort us out
where was donald card at the time 
there were three of them it was at night i cannot identify
him they would beat us up behind the prison
thank you sir is that all the evidence mr nongena
i i don’t want to continue now but the white man in robben
island also illtreated me when after we had been sentenced in robben
island by the time mandela got into jail we were there already being
do you have a request in connection with this incident 
i do there are a lot of people who died in our area in the
struggle for liberation there should be some form of project for the
whole village i do not want to have compensations just for myself i
want it for the entire village because it was for the people that i was
i will hand over to the chairperson
thank you mr chairperson mr nongena i’d like to ask you a
question you said that at night when you were taken behind the prison
there were three people mazinxanti that you knew who was
what about the others what type of a man was he 
do you perhaps know who the rd person was 
yes it is xanti whose mentioned his name
when xanti said that card is going to sort you out what did
he would kick us punch us he was demanding the truth so to
what was the duration of time 
it was over a few days it is charles and hatanga that were
there all the time card was not there all the time i said that they
must take a true report put it on my forehead and rather shoot me
therefore you’re saying that card was there only on one
yes he was present the one night only
mr boyi maybe you can clarify the form of torture that was
you people mr nongena said that a straightjacket was used as a form of
torture what were they using with you 
they were beating us up punching and kicking
in your evidence you said there were three policemen but
the one you remember is card you’ve forgotten the others could you
give us a reason why it is that you would remember card only
i remember his name because a lot of people were talking about
card in a similar manner this is why i did not forget his name he was
xanti sebe known as charles sebe was he in king william’s
he was stationed in east london but i would see him often in
king william’s town but apparently he was stationed in east london
in your evidence mr boyi in your evidence you mentioned
johnson nongena sorry it is the other gentleman that mentioned his
name please give him the mike mr nongena in your evidence your
mentioned johnson nongena where you arrested together
when you were tortured with the method of a straightjacket
he was there but he’d been shot already we were in
we were not in the same cell
are there people that you remember who are still alive who
would help us with this evidence witnesses perhaps 
the person who would help me has passed away he had a car
accident he would help me were he alive
the last question mr boyi when you were arrested you were
at work your boss called you and told you that the police had come to
arrest you do you remember your boss’s name 
athangkite is now referred to as water affairs
you probably don’t know his first name because we did not
know outr boss’s first names at the time who botha 
no i don’t know him we just referred to him as botha i don’t
expect you to know because we referred to him as baas
thank you for your evidence it humbles us to know that this
battle was fought from of old by elderly people like you our parents
people under the impression that the youths in the ’s were the people
of the struggle for liberation as we are learning and growing within the
commission especially in pondoland we heard elderly elderly men who
were fighting in the early ’s on the mountains in pondoland for
liberation that makes us realize that we are a people who sacrificed
themselves from of old for the liberation that we have today thank you
even though you were touched deeply and you cried we are not happy they
they hurt us we thank you that when you were asked to list your
requests you were altruistic enough to think of the other people in the
village and not yourself a lot of people are selfcentered if they need
a mat that is that they forget about the rest of the nation
	your request that there be a monument for all those who passed on
through the struggle for liberation you said that there should also be a
project that would help the people of the village and not yourself there
are only a few men like you we should learn from you so that we also
can be honourable people one day we thank you both for your evidence we
request that you now step down knowing that you have touched us deeply
we welcome you mr clarke you have already introduced yourself to us
but just for sake of record could you please just confirm that you are
who you are and the instructions that have been given to you
thank you mr chairperson i am i’ve been requested to assist
mr donald card at the hearing and the name is clarke the initial i
welcome mr card we will request you to take the oath so
that the testimony that are giving is under oath over to you reverend
 the speaker’s mike is not on
thank you mr card and mr clarke i will i will be asking
mr clarke perhaps just to quickly address us on the procedure that he
wants to follow but before i do so i would like to welcome you we had
some confusion when your name was
mentioned in a hearing in queenstown by a certain mr yoyo at that time
we operated on the understanding that we are not required to give
notification but since then we have had a ruling of the appellate
division which requires us to give notification of a person who is likely
to be named in a hearing and who according to the statement received by
us is named as an alleged perpetrator so we duly given you notification
in this regard and you have indicated that you would like to come and
give your side of the story to the commission so that it’s on record and
whatever decision we contemplate making on the matter we have your side
of the story and this is the opportunity for you to do so but of course
mr clarke will take his responsibility of choosing the matter that he
may i just clarify firstly that the matter was postponed on
monday i understand until today but the date and time of today of 
o’clock was actually arranged with advocate sandi and it wasn’t that we
weren’t here on monday it was actually a time arranged with advocate
sandi to appear today if i may just clarify that issue
well we regret the misinformation that we received
thank you the other aspect the first aspect that arises we
were furnished with a summary of the evidence to be given by mr boyi and
by mr nongena we have listened this morning to their evidence on the
strength of the summary which was furnished to us an affidavit was
prepared by mr card by us on behalf of mr card and has been handed to
the commission and which i understand is in your possession it dealt
with the allegations as set out in the summary although as it indicated
was a very brief summary mr card did the best he could to deal with the
however from listening to the evidence this morning from mr boyi
particularly that there seems to be a measure of deviation from the
summary that was handed to us in that the summary alleges that the
incidents took place as is listed in or set out in paragraph of the
summary during or around as i understood mr boyi’s evidence this
morning nothing transpired as far as mr card is concerned in 
but that the incident took place in and as such there were further
allegations set out in the summary which obviously do not pertain any
longer to mr card for example if i may read the allegations contained
therein that he was in severely assaulted and tortured certainly
from his evidence today certainly it does not relate to mr card in any
way and he says he was shot while being interrogated he didn’t actually
mention that today as far as i could hear and that was also alled he was
shot in i’m not sure who today he alleges shot him or whether is
still alleges that he was shot he does mention that he was continuously
harassed by allegedly by mr card and mr xanti sebe at times he visited
in work but only but he doesn’t allege that today as far i can see
either if i may lead mr card to deal with the allegations as they have
mr card you’ve heard the allegations today i think that it is common
cause there was no allegation against you in respect of any incident in
 as the evidence was led today and as i put to the commissioner it
was contrary to the to the summary that was given to us as to the
allegations that were made in any event if we deal with the
allegations do you know mr makhi boyi have you met him before
i’ve never seen him in my life mr chairman members of the
committee i saw him here for the first time in fact i was looking
around to see who were the who would be looking at me to see who i was
today to see whether i could identify and only
when they came up here did i realize for the first time that those were
obviously the people i have never seen them in my life before
well just an interruption mr clarke i’m sorry we are
doing a very important work here perhaps the others don’t think so but
this is very important please give us an opportunity to do our work
properly in with dignity with no comments from the floor when the two
gentlemen in front are giving their evidence thank you for your help
mr chairperson i’d like just to continue to deal with the
allegations as they were presented this morning
mr chairman i think what i should do is deal with some of the
issues that i had in my original statement and then i’ll i can deal with
what is being said here i repeat that i do not know these two gentlemen
nor did i know the gentleman from who made the allegation in queenstown
mr yoyo i’ve never i’ve never seen them in my life before mr chairman
i joined the police force in i became a detective and my
duties as a policeman was to keep law and order in this country in
accordance with the existing laws at no time did i consider that i
should not take steps against those who broke the law merely because
they were fighting against the injustices of the apartheid laws i want
that clear that was my duties at the time and when that did become an
issue i resigned from the police force in other words at a later stage
in my life i realized that in fact it was affecting me and i resigned
with regard to where i was and now at i think let me start off by
saying that i because i was i was i’m a xhosa linguist i was sent by
the commissioner of police to various
places throughout the country and i must say i think i was successful
with regard to the cases i handled i handles cases in port elizabeth i
handled cases in cape town in durban pretoria and johannesburg i was
very well known amongst all the political people in this country in fact
i also gave evidence in the rivonia trial so i know my name was bandied
about quite a lot and i can also say that there were times when i was in
other parts of the country that allegations were made against me and it
was obviously a mistaken identity i want to say right now mr chairman
that i don’t deny what these gentlemen are saying maybe they were
assaulted but whatever the case is it’s mistaken identity i was
definitely not here i have never worked in king william’s town there’s
a possibility and the odd time that i passed through here i want to say
that i didn’t work with charles sebe i went with him on one occasion i
was involved with him we went to robben island in connection with anc
matters and not pac matters i went with him to robben island and we came
back together but i never worked with charles sebe here in king
william’s town gert hattingh and i worked together on a sabotage case at
alice where a pole was cut and at that while we were together he
became a well lets call him a confident of mine and he told me how he
had smashed allan paton’s car windows up at hogsback from that day mr
chairman we were in two different camps we never sat together and there
was no ways that i would have been involved with hattingh after that in
fact mr chairman we involved in a supreme court case because of that
issue i want to point that if these gentlemen if somebody had said it
was it was donald card and they are mentioning the name donald card
it’s from someone mentioning my name but not me in person you know
it’s very difficult now for me to to to sort of recollect i went
through old papers in fact i’d given my attorney documents and they’re
not really proper documents they’re documents from newspapers giving
dates of where i was up until about so i haven’t been able to
get all that sorted out now but in mr chairman i was involved
when a pac member who was operating from maseru came back into this
country and i arrested him and through information i got from him i
dealt with a lot of issues in cape town i was in cape town quite a lot
i was in east london i dealt with certain issues there that was 
 mr chairman end of ‘ ‘ there were two gentlemen who were
trying to reorganize the anc organization throughout this country and i
was involved in those cases but i want to repeat not in king william’s
town i did not ever operate from king i did not come from east london
to operate in king i came from east london to operate in port elizabeth
cape town johannesburg pretoria and durban but never in oh yes and
once in alice i was in alice in march when the pole was cut down
there but never in king william’s town and if those gentlemen say that
i that i assaulted them definitely a mistaken identity i didn’t do it
and i want to say mr chairman that if i did do it i would have been the
first one to come to this commission to the truth commission and asked
for amnesty i would have asked for amnesty because what did i what
would i lose by asking for amnesty i would have come i’ve asked for
amnesty in another matter but i would have come if there was any reason
for me to come i could never mr chairman ask for amnesty when i know
i’m not guilty i cannot associate myself with anything like that i’m
innocent i’m going through pain because of the innocence in sitting here
thank you mr card mr clarke does that conclude your
matter for now we are going to be raising a few questions from our
side and we thank you for
your submission we have noted the comments that you have made
preliminary comments raising the discrepancy in terms of the statement
originally statement oral evidence which has been led here and will
apply amongst that questions mr sandi 
thank you mr chairman there is an old saying mr card that
says dead men tell no tales i noticed that in your submission you
mentioned two names and that is mr hattingh and mr sebe i understand
both men have since deceased is that correct
mr chairman i didn’t mention them they were mentioned by the
statements that i got and i actually said that unfortunately they are
dead otherwise they could have come here to tell this commission what
the story was cause they could have said i wasn’t here now i never i
haven’t mentioned them they were mentioned by the previous gentlemen
in my statement i have mentioned maynard and baba goosen the
two gentlemen i worked with all the time over that period
no no no they’re alive no no i the the people that are
dead the mention hattingh was associated to me by these two gentlemen
and charles sebe are dead but i still believe that the officer in charge
of the security at that stage is still alive he’s in pretoria but the
gentleman who was in charge of me who was an ordinary criminal
investigation department he’s dead that was colonel heydrech
do you think these three old men have any particular reasons to
i’ve i’ve no idea mr chairman all i can say that is that
identity it’s not donald card they mention the name donald card mr
chairman i can bring up books all sorts of things if you want to you
can have a look at at sichaba who mentions me way back these comrades
against apartheid you’ll see that my name is mentioned in here as the
person who in fact created a lot of problems for the anc in their early
days because of my involvement it’s on page there are a lot of
people that wrote about me and have spoken about me over the over the
period of time and know my name i was the mayor of east london i got
the freedom of the city of east london i’ve been in the eyes of a lot of
people for a long time yes i’ve fought against the sabotage laws at
least i’ve fought against people in bringing people to justice at one
stage and i was mentioned by a lot of people these gentlemen could
believe at this stage that they heard my name and that i must be the
person but i’m telling you i’m not the person mr chairman i was
definitely not here and the lord knows that as well
before we proceed to the next question can i ask should we
assume it to be a matter of mere coincidence that you have quite a number
of people who mistake your identity they implicate you in things you’ve
not been involved in is it just a coincidence 
i can’t answer mr chairman i wouldn’t mind that this
commission could answer me on that one cause really i don’t know why
they’ve done it i can mention that i did speak to a member of the pac
who was in custody with them on robben island and he told me that they
had mentioned that a mr stoltz was the chap who assaulted them now there
is a stoltz he’s a retired policeman and he was here at one
stage and he’s at port alfred i don’t know whether that story is correct
was told by a member of the pac who was in custody with them
thank you mr chairman i will stop for a moment maybe i will
back for further questions thank you
thank you mr chairperson mr card i only have one question
for you was there another policeman by your name in the police force at
that time possibly based in the same area 
in fact that could have resulted in this mistaken identity 
no i did have a son in the police force who was also a d
card but he only came he joined the police force many many years
afterwards not at that time at all
do you have any idea at all what could have resulted in this
do you have idea at all what could have caused this mistaken
i have no idea mr chairman i also want to say that i find it
very funny that if people were put in straightjackets and thrown into
the buffalo river as was alleged and that they were shot at that when
the case came to court that no mention was made and there was never a
case because if there was a case and i was a suspect i would have been
approached and i would have been warned in terms of the judge’s rules
nothing like that has ever taken place so it’s the first time that it’s
now been brought out and i cannot understand why because i want to say
that although there were probably a
lot of injustices in the ’s and ‘’s there was one organisation
which was above any political issues and that was the magistrates and the
judges in the courts and if anybody had laid a complaint at that stage
and if anybody was shot during interrogation or anybody put in a
straightjacket and thrown into the river surely to goodness when they
came to court on that occasion the matter would have been dealt with and
i find that one of the reasons i’m giving you now was something strange
from my side why wasn’t that done 
thank you mr chairman i just want to know first from mr
card whether he would in fact remember the faces of all the persons who
went through his hands in terms of investigation and interrogation
no mr chairman i won’t remember many of them but i do in fact
even today remember a lot of the people that i dealt with at that time
i had an ability to identify and remember unfortunately that the memory
side is a little bit faded even names now faces still don’t are not a
problem but names have become almost impossible i sometimes i see a
face and i think who is that and minutes after that i’ll remember who
that person is but really my memory isn’t so good anymore and i wouldn’t
you realize that probably because of age these gentlemen
who were here have also changed a lot in terms of their features and
probably the flesh on their faces so it would be hard really to try and
mr chairman i can i grew up in transkei and i’m not a i have
no problems with faces whether they’re white black brown or any other
to tell you that if i had seen those gentlemen that were here today
even though it’s years ago i would remember them
i just want to ask another question question is was it
common practice for police to rough up prisoners in order to get
information from them during the course of your interrupted
there were cases yes there were definitely cases like that
but it depended of course what they were questioning them for i mean i
dealt with people that a large number of people and there were those
some of those who later obviously for their own reasons said that they
were assaulted when they weren’t assaulted and obviously they do it for a
reason because some of them talk to the police immediately and they have
to go back and tell the story that they have that they have spoken and
in fact that they and in fact that they it was forced out of them
many many people i can tell you many people that i dealt with were
never touched mr chairman can i just tell one story just to help you
on that issue in the th of april there were a crowd of pac chaps
who were going to attack east london and i went in amongst them and the
leader of that that group was washington siklese and i sat and watched
him dividing the people into groups to go and attack police stations and
i sat watching and i gave evidence before the court he got years
imprisonment mr chairman he later came up i went and saw him on robben
island and he came to grahamstown to give evidence and most a lot of the
people were allowed to go move as they liked they were wearing prison
garb they were serving terms of imprisonment siklese served years
imprisonment and because the others were walking around he said to me
mr card won’t you give me
 night out in the grahamstown township and i said to him i can’t do
me finally mr chairman i said to him ok you can go oh he said to
me you can trust me mr card that was the leader of the pac in east
london and mr chairman i allowed him to go to the township for the
night he took off his prison garb put on clothes and he went off and he
came back now i just want to say if he is the leader of the pac i
could do that to him isn’t there a problem with what’s happening today 
thank you i just want last comment the comment is
that in your remarks you’re actually saying that only persons of our
region with integrity were the courts of law the magistrates
no no i didn’t say the only people mr chairman i said
there’s one group of people that were you you couldn’t go against their
integrity and that was the courts of law
in our experience with the police we have come across a
number of cases in which a person is roughed up in jail and them he is
taken to a magistrate in the afternoon to give evidence because he must
appear before a magistrate within so many hours and as a person appears
before the magistrate as he goes there he’s going with security
police who will say to him excuse my language you tell the magistrate
that we have neuked you up jy sal kak because you’re going to come up
you’re going to come back to us there are several people who who would
testify to that the magistrate would look at you and he sees that you
have a blue eye and he doesn’t remonstrate the police about that but i
want to say that we have had magistrates also who have not been who have
not had any sense of integrity when it came to blacks because i think
they were in the same war in a whiteblack war now i would like to make
mr chairman unfortunately i i’m not i haven’t been sitting
on a commission to hear all these stories but i can tell you from my
experience with a magistrate and the judges there was never anything
like that i had the highest regard for the magistrates and the judges
and let me say that in the times that i had dealings with magistrates in
fact i thought on a number of occasions there should have been guilty
certain people should have been found guilty and they were actually found
not guilty i thought that as far as i was concerned justice was one of
the departments that you couldn’t point a finger at and i might be wrong
you are raising are you finished 
no i’m just wanting to say that the facts that i raised
before the commission and asking you are facts which have a proven
record too and so there is a conflict in people’s perceptions about
i put up my hands mr chair i surrender on that one
just a short question mr card in paragraph of your
affidavit you speak about another team of men who were given the task of
investigating the king william’s town police station attack two parts to
my question the first one did you know who they were at all 
no i know that hattingh was amongst them but i don’t know
who i can’t remember who that team was but i know that there was i was
dealing with a with a with a that very big issue in east london where
we finally picked up within a few
months we picked up over well people well about people so
months we picked up over well people well about people so
there all the time i had no idea who was involved here but i do know
that gert hattingh was one of those who did work here
and the second part of the question is just to ask you who
was it who was actually directing the operations in terms of you being
kept in east london others being sent to east london who was 
as far as i know i don’t know who dealt with that who was in
charge but i was told on the night of the th that i would be taking
over the investigation of the east london you know the east london case
and i don’t know who gave the instruction for the other areas but my
local police officer the one who i said is dead now he instructed that
i take over that investigation and bring it to a conclusion
thank you thank you mr chairman
mr card just one last question from me we can spend the
whole day raising questions with you and soliciting your opinions on a
number of issues but your case as you are perhaps now aware has become
one of the more curious cases especially in our region for this
commission the key question is who is donald card what is the truth
about that there is the picture of on one hand there is the picture of
donald card the hero a man who lays his life on the line sacrificing
all in order to take that fateful step of trying of assisting donald
wood into exile donald card who we have to respect to admire to
	then there is on the other hand this other picture of donald card if
you can excuse my words donald card the monster who terrorized
freedom fighters in this area old peasant men who were trying to make a
statement about the need for democracy in our country how they were
terrorized and placed under terrible conditions by that donald card the
key question is who is the donald card before us and as a commission we
have to come to an answer one way or the other on that matter i’ve
already informed you in my letter to you that it’s not only mr yoyo it’s
not only these two gentlemen that there are several other matters which
have not come for public hearing which have cited your name but i hope
you remember the letter that i sent you in that regard
yes mr chairman i’m still waiting for the copies of those
letters too mr chairman can i say that it’s donald card the realist
donald card and i in my original statement you will see that i i
served in the police force and today mr chairman if policemen don’t
serve the government that’s in power then you have no government you
have a problem and i at that stage not that i was backing the national
government i was a policeman you must realize mr chairman it was
shortly after the war my father was poor i couldn’t go to
university i had to go and look for a job if i wasn’t a returned
soldier i didn’t get a job i ended up in the police force and i decided
i would make a success of the police force which i did and mr chairman
i stuck to my guns the law of the country was the law but then as i
became more mature interrupted i want to tell you who donald
can i just interrupt you at that stage 
i want to interrupt you at this stage that you are
describing did you perhaps in retrospect look back into that period and
find that in your zeal to make a
success of yourself as a policeman you may have in the process of that
actually have abused other people’s human rights is that possible 
no mr chairman i don’t believe i did i believe i operated
within the laws at the time
i don’t believe that i that i abused them then i want to say
mr chairman that at a later stage i realized through working with all
the people involved i realized that in fact that the apartheid system
was an absolute disaster and if you remember that in the it was in the
‘’s already that i started preaching and people were calling me a
communist and a fight at least anti south african antigovernment and
all the rest of it i stuck to my guns that’s the person you’re dealing
with mr chairman you’re dealing with a person who will tell you the
truth and i’ve told you today what the truth is i’m not i beg to
differ with you mr chairman i don’t see myself as the i don’t know
what you called me a monster i was not the monster mr chairman i was
doing a job at that stage and if i was asked to do a job today i would
still do it in fact i wouldn’t mind coming back to the police force
we’d sort out a lot of problems mr chairman
laughs ja i regret perhaps the use of that word i was
just trying to summarize the other picture that is portrayed by the
statements before us they portray the picture of a monster i’m not
putting that it’s it’s what is portrayed by these kinds of statements
mr chairman i was one of those in who went to lusaka
to try and look for peace
well thank you mr card as i say we could go on the whole
day we have a very serious task before us as this commission to try and
find the truth not as perhaps as you perceive it but as you and them
will come to be reconciled in the truth a truth that will heal the
wounds of the many people in the country and perhaps deal with why people
mr chairman i would like to have sat together with these two
gentlemen and discussed these things here in front of everybody let’s
find out where we where the problem lay because the problem is not
mine mr chairman i can that i’m quite sure of in fact i thought
these gentlemen would come in here today and say no i’m sorry it’s not
that card it’s somebody else that’s what i believe today
well thank you very much thank you mr clarke and thank
you mr card we hope that this is not the end of our meeting we may
have to meet again for a more indepth look at this particular dilemma
that we are in as a commission on this matter thank you very much

boers ran away when they saw us because we were armed i recognized one
of them he had a gun in his hand i had a petrol bomb and an assegai i
threw that assegai he was he was standing metres away from me the
other men had ran away njopo was the only one who was there with me
when i was about to leave i got shot and i was struck in my leg i then
tried to run away when we were about to reach a corner i could not run
any longer there was blood i tried to hide in a rubbish bin after a
while i saw them with a torch i hought it was in the morning it was at
about in the morning i thought that he did not see me he passed me
he then came back he said come out poqo we were known as poqo at the

sketch a picture of the context in which this incident took place what
the situation was here in grahamstown and what your role was in that
let us begin mr mbekela when this incident took place and when
the house in which you were sleeping was set alight and one of the
occupants miseka ntonyela died what would you describe the situation in
grahamstown as having been at that time
thank you honourable sir and also honourable chairperson we
could say that it was nothing new to us all being seated here today the
situation especially in the s particularly from onwards was
one which was very unpleasant where the people of south africa
especially the youth at that time was fed up with being oppressed they
just had enough of the people of south africa having been oppressed i
would say mr chairperson that the people of south africa were determined
to overthrow the government of the day they did not want the government
at that time and the residential areas of black persons looking at
people who lived around border areas the border areas were not
residential areas any more they war more war zones because the
soldieres police and military people who had been sent on crash courses
and were known as nats here in the location were trained with the
objecive of killing people that lived in the locations and they were
	as i have said honourable committee members and commissioners people
were not happy to just sit back and fold their hands they picked up
whatever they could to defend themselves with but with the objective in
mind that south africa should be free
was there any organisation within the area which existed at the
time could you just describe it to us if there was
there were organisations there was a residential association
known as graca there was another one which still exists today known as
cosas there was a womens league known as the grahamstown womens league
which was part of the anc womens league also the youth organisation
known as graico and at that stage the decision was taken that these
organisations be formed and in since a decision had been taken at a
cosas conference in that it is important that a youth organisation
be formed known as youth congress the youth who were not attending
school at the time took the initiative and here in grahamstown a
grahamstown youth congress was formed but at that time there would be
organisations for grahamstown p e east london and so forth
	but because we knew that the battle for south africa was not a regional
battle there was a decision taken that there should be one organisation
formed for the entire country because we were not fighting battles for
grahamstown individually or individual regions and thats why in a
meeting was held in durban where the national youth organisation was
formed but it was an interim committee
we are now talking about the period and at the time you
were a member of the graico organisation here grahamstown could you just
very briefly tell us about that
at that time chairperson i was the chairperson of the
grahamstown youth congress we at that stage were busy in organising the
youth and informing people as to exactly what the people of south africa
wanted what kind of freedom we were striving for because if we could
remember correctly mr chairperson the logo of the grahamstown youth
congress was a trend which showed that it did not necessarily mean that
the youth did not want to be educated but it was an indication that we
wanted the youth to be educated that is why we said that in our
meetings and there was also pickaxe where we showed that there are
workers amongst the youth as well and that showed in which direction we
were moving so that they could see what kind of liberation we were
fighting for there was also within the logo of the grahamstown youth
congress an assegai which showed that the assegai was a sign that even
when the youth wanted to go for training the objective was to get rid of
the oppressive government that was why our slogan was freedom now and
before we speak about the incident of the th of may 
were there any problems which you encountered with regards to the police
let me put it this way mr chairperson i could say that i was
one of the persons who was more fortunate i wouldnt regard myself as
having been more fortunate than others i was still very young to have
attended school at an early stage while others were only at metutu
school at seven years of age i started school at the age of five and at
some stage i went to durban and i matriculated in in there
were problems because even in durban i did not just rest on my laurels i
came back here in and when i got here i familiarised myself with
what was happening because people were more politically active and that
was the last time i led a stable life mr chairperson in because at
that stage i wasnt sleeping at home anymore my parents would testify to
that because even when i got home i wouldnt even sit down and have a
meal i would have a meal on my feet and id been all over the country
durban johannesburg port elizabeth where we were mobilising this
organisation there was something else which we called scuttling i would
refer to that as township terminology which describes when one has to
hide and the police made life unbearable to and extent where they would
even break into cars just so that we would be nervous all the time and
where they would take you for interrogation and constantly threaten your
	id like to sketch this very clearly because even when we speak about
the spirit of reconciliation we place it in a proper south african
political context in the same way that i am here today in the situation
which i am going to describe its just a pity that one of the police i
think it was wo strydom died during the state of emmergency i dont
know if he realised that the situation was beyond his control because
when he spoke to me during interrogation he would want to know when we
were going to stop this because they were going to kill us there was a
day because i even assisted samu which is a workers union which was led
by phila nkaye and tobile mseleni and the like and while i was seen
there i was still very young i was then taken to these buildings which
the youth knew as the carlton centre and this wo strydom was there and
the others fonya and company were also there end of tapeand thats
the security branch and particularly in grahamstown as at the time was
full of black people who would just sit there and not question you but
they would merely be sent to arrest you and when it came to
interrogation they would just sit there and not participate i would hate
to think that it was lack of intellect
	we had also organised burial committees and i was representing the youth
at the burial committees and at that that stage there was the
organisation called graca and i was then called in and questioned about
this burial committee and there was nothing which we hid i explained to
them that the intention of the burial committee was to assist the parents
of victims because for some people it was very difficult in some homes
you would find that they did not even have any refreshments or anything
and we would send our people to go to the shop and collect money and
some shop owners would even give us food and strydom said to me chris
what were going to do to you is come to your house i said to him that i
dont have a problem with that he said do you know what were going to
come and do there and i said that it was for him to come and tell me
	he said that what they would do is go there and sit there for a long
time and ask for tea or something and then people would come and attack
us after they had left thinking that i was an informer i said that i
dont believe that people would be that rash yes people would do that in
the past but they would be able to differentiate between someone who is
trying to destroy the apartheid system and someone who wasnt they said
that the reason why they were telling me this is because they were going
to kill me the reason why im saying this is because i know it was very
painful even for the mtimkulu family and some of the people who are
applying for amnesty where some people were denied that even meister who
is a supposed leader knew about and knew that it had already been decided
that myself and other comrades were short listed to be killed and on a
particular day we left for rhodes university to some comrades who were
	there were three of us and we were intercepted by the security police
and there was one gentleman whom i knew at the time and towards our
release he was transferred to pretoria they stopped the three of us
they had these search lights which practically blinded you if shone in
your face they asked us where we were coming from and we told them and
they said we were lying and that we would see what helped us was that a
hippo was coming in our direction and we were saved by the fact that they
misunderstood this hippo to be saying that they should go if that had
not happened i would not have had this opportunity to come and tell you
mr mbekela on the th of may when they set your place
alight would you just sketch to us what happened there
i was no longer sleeping at home i was sleeping all over the
show on that day when this incident took place i had already received
information that they were guarding my place and im sure some people who
are here had been working for the police at the time would know that i
wasnt sleeping at home any longer and i dont know what happened that
day i entered my from the back i never used the front door any longer
we used to jump over the fence and it was after this incident took
	when we got in we went to the room and what i remember was the way in
which we were startled by the flames which started to come in and it was
not a petrol bomb it was a fire bomb which became apparent during the
investigations it was discovered during the investigations and a
specialist opinion was obtained and it was established that it was
	chairperson when this incident took place and when we were startled i
grabbed miseka and we ran the room in which we were was engulfed by
flames by the time i grabbed her im sure that we must have parted when
we got to the door because i would say that at that time i was not
thinking straight and she was shouting looking for me and i was looking
for her but what we did was to phone the police firstly i knew they
were very sensitive because they would always have an excuse in spite of
the bad situation i phoned the police and their phone was engaged so i
tried again but it was still engaged i tried to phone the ambulance but
it was engaged i then phoned priscilla hall who was someone who worked
with us and she responded and said she was on her way
	someone else who i called was olivia visser i know that her name was
associated with investigating people who were involved with the anc at
the time i got there and we were taken in different cars to the
hospital when we got to the hospital mr chairperson we were separated
miseka had burns on her body and i was told by superintendent white
that i should be admitted i think hes in p e now i refused to be
admitted because at the time there was information that the security
branch was outside and at the time they thought that i was dead and when
they discovered that i was still alive they wanted to kidnap me so that i
	the person who advised me was roland white because he had pictures of me
as well and he said to me that i should not allow myself to be admitted
because if i did i would disappear without a trace and roland white was
chased thereafter i dont know who chased him although security
	the fact that we are here now is because we as victims deem it very
important because the people of south africa have shown the new
government that we do not bear grudges as such we did not fight for
liberation at the time so that we could prosecute these people once we
were in power and the person who was leading the security branches
meister should come to the fore and say whether these took place with
his knowledge or without and if they were done with his knowledge what
he did about them the names of persons who were used by them to
prosecute us should be exposed so that we can know who we can forgive
because you cannot forgive someone without knowing who to forgive
	if im not mistaken the following day miseka was sent to livingstone
that is what happened mr chairperson
you said in your statement that you did not lay a charge with
we did not lay a charge mr chairperson the situation i was
in at the time would have made it very difficult for me to go and lay a
charge because if i had done that i would have been arrested i would
have been handing myself over to the police basically because they came
to look for me several times to get me to lay a charge i only made a
when you were arrested in june what was your situation like
firstly i was not arrested in june i was arrested after the
state of emmergency was declared after mathews goniwes burial in july
the situation at the time was that all activists were psychologically
unwell because what was important was that you had to understand your
situation so that you could do your own selfcounselling by psyching
yourself the situation which i and others were in was that
psychologically we were unwell because on the one hand you were being
hunted on the other hand you were not sleeping at home and privately you
were disorganised so i was in a situation of turmoil to put it properly
you said that you wished to know who these people were that did
mr chairperson i would like to know the perpetrators the
people who did this to me and the people who were working with them so
that we can reconcile here in south africa because what is important is
to build the nation because we saw what apartheid did to the people
is that all you wanted to say
secondly if it is possible the truth commission i would
like it to help the victim because she is no longer here the life of a
person is priceless but if the government or the truth commission would
recommend something that would show that her life had value the family
would be satisfied to know who were the people who did this to her
thank you mr mbekela let us now go to ms koliwe tonyela
yes mr chairperson she was my sister
how old was she at the time
how did you hear about this incident that miseka got injured
when the house was put alight
miseka visited her boy friend she was supposed to go to work
at six but she did not come home we thought that she woke up late so she
decided to go straight to work we went to work and at half past nine our
father came and said me miseka was in livingstone hospital she was in a
house that was set alight so she was burnt i asked who did this and my
father said he didnt know but we have to go home and go to the hospital
	before we went to livingstone my brother decided to phone there and we
were told that she had been admitted to that hospital and was in room b
we then went to port elizabeth and arrived there at about and went to
see her she was badly burnt i didnt even recognise her she was dark
black like a tyre she couldnt even see i asked miseka what was it and
she told me that they were looking for christian and were bombed while
sleeping she tried to escape but couldnt i asked her who did this who
did she suspect and she said that she thought that they were boers
	we couldnt talk to her and then decided to go back to grahamstown and
phoned our brother in port elizabeth he visited her the following day at
about eleven and was then told that she passed away
on the day of the funeral were you disturbed by the police
we were not disturbed by the police the funeral continued
do you have a request to make before this commission today
yes i have a request i would like the perpetrators to come
forward so that we can know who they are
you also mentioned a tombstone do you remember what you said
yes i did mention something about a tombstone
can you please tell us what it was
i told my family about this but they disagreed with me
is that all you want to say
thank you ms tonyela thank you mr chairperson
let me ask mr mbekela a question you say that you were
advised to leave the hospital who gave you this advice
he was in rhodes university in an organisation called nusas
why did he advise you to leave the hospital
because he saw the security police in hospital he took their
photographs and he also took misekas and my photographs after that he
at the time how were you injured you said that miseka had
i was burned from my back up and down my legs
there were specialists who used to come and treat me but i
would be treated in places where i would spend the night there are also
other doctors whose names i wont mention now
according to your knowledge was there cooperation between
the security police and the authorities in the hospital
i can say so because the situation at that time you wouldnt
separate between the authorities and the police because when i told the
superintendent in the hospital that im not going to spend the night we
fought because he wanted me to spend the night there i told him that it
was my right not to do so if i dont want to spend the night other
people were allowed that right and i told him that because roland also
advised me in front of him he told me that the security police were in
the hospital they were looking for me
	he didnt treat me well he didnt use cotton wool he just put
elastoplaster on my wounds but there were other people who sympathised
with me especially from other places after that i was arrested under the
state of emmergency i was charged with arson murder of the police you
can not run away from the fact that after this incident people were very
angry the police who are will remember that all the police were chased
away from the township they accused me of instigating the sithule
people that the police were to be chased away
	some of the charges were dropped while i was arrested under the state of
emmergency but i recovered when i was in prison all in all mr
chairperson i would say the superintendent was in connection with the
police he also played a role and if it is possible i would like him to
come forward to the commission to say if i spoke the truth or what but i
think now he is in port elizabeth
thank you very much the question i just asked about the
part taken by the hospitals i asked this question because the commission
is preparing to have a hearing which is going to focus on the people who
participated in health services the evidence we received showed clearly
that there was a connection between the police and the people who were
supposed to take care of peoples health
	as the commission we will look at other professional bodies because they
did not kill people they did not shoot people but they played a role in
oppressing people although they did not shoot them directly some people
got injured but they were not able to go to hospitals for medical car
because they saw that there was cooperation between the police and the
	we thank you for clarifying this matter because we are going to have a
hearing with the health services we also thank you for giving us a
picture a full picture of the struggle of the youth here in grahamstown
we want to sympathise with you especially you ms tonyela and her family
and her family because you lost your sister in this painful manner
i dont want to waste time talking to you because i can see that you
understand that your sister died for liberation at that time you request
you made especially concerning the perpetrators that they must come
forward i hope that those that are here in grahamstown those that were
involved are listening today and they would come forward you assured
them in advance that you would forgive them all that you need is that
they should acknowledge that they are the ones responsible for this
may i please call samson kodibona samson good afternoon
thank you for coming samson you are taking us back to 
and before i hand over the doctor ally who’s going to be helping
you with your statement can i ask you to please stand to take the oath
will you repeat after me the story i’m about to tell is the
truth and nothing else but the truth so help me god
samson thank you for coming and welcome you’re gonna speak
about your experiences which relate to to being tortured because of the
political views you held and and you political activities and you’re
gonna describe two incidents as the chairperson said in ‘ the first
and then again in so i’m going to ask you to go through what
actually happened to you and to focus specifically on the kind of torture
it was in i met with three men from their looks they
were travelling on a van which was a police car it looked like they were
cid’s it was in the morning when i met them i used to train in the
morning when i met them they stopped and i just continued running and i
running towards i ran towards their direction when i reached them they
didn’t talk much they grabbed me and then they took me out of the way
just a distance from from the road they started torturing me asked me
questions they were asking me about people like peter nchabaling nelson
diyali mr inkadimeng mr pokanuka mr parlo i would say that i told
them that i didn’t know the people they were asking me about from there
they tortured me hitting me and they interrogated me they took me and
they put a net over my head and they put me back into the van then i
travelled with them but i couldn’t see exactly as to where we were going
when we arrived at this place i still had the net on my head they again
questioned me as to whether i knew the people they asked me about they
asked me how do i know them
i didn’t exactly know these people i stayed there for the whole day
until late in the afternoon and then they took off the net and i could
now see or recognize the place i was in it was a place in stierpoort
again they put the net over my head and they throw me into the van and
they drove me back from where i came and they left me at the scene where
they found me where they found me it was a main road from skukune
towards the skukune magistrate offices i will say it’s a place calls
	i went back home when i arrived back home and i reported the matter my
front teeth were broken some of them have just cracked at the time i
told my parents my parents took this issue as a general issue normally
that normally happens that young boys go around and provoke other people
this worried me a lot i continued schooling at school we used to
discuss things like uprisings the riots and other political
activities which happened during the early ’s it was not just a place
where there were riots and boycotts it was calm we’re just school
children and we are attending school properly and there there wasn’t any
any other problem normally when it comes to politics only a few
individuals were involved and i would say this worried me a lot after a
stage where i came to believe that police were not good people and
they’re not people of good manners and i stayed with my cousin two
cousins and we used to hand around together they used to guide me they
said and they guarded me that we have to continue studying and they have
to go behind me in trying to guide me as to how to go around life
however they could see that i wasn’t spiritually well from there i
couldn’t in my life trust a policeman and especially the old government
which i could say was undemocratic and that continued with myself hating
the system until i was grown up and i was motivated by teachers whom i’ve
told to whom i’ve told my story
	early i grew up with this spirit this political spirit i was a
kind of person who like provoking the old government or the regime
actually i’m saying that i wasn’t the kind of person who liked to provoke
them i couldn’t understand why they started around harassing me it was
until i was working at the air force a base force this was the
south african defence force days and the police which we call them sadaf
meaning sadf i worked with a man by the name of mr ferguson who was my
lieutenant this man was a kind of man who didn’t like african people
they usually called me terrorist that became my name they never called
me by my real name they usually referred to me as a terrorist up until
the stage where while we were working under such conditions in we
had to quarrel because they called me a terrorist and i had to tell them
that i am not a terrorist i am samson kodibona but they continued
	they have to move me to another place where i had to work for at 
squadron this the kind of an air force base where all those types of
planes normally land and even they they continued calling me a terrorist
and i wasn’t free as i was going around doing my job normally there will
be people who come around and watch me while doing the job they also had
the spirit that they have to remove me from where they were working
because they regarded me as a terrorist in february on the
seventh i was called to the office they gave me a letter and i had to
take this letter to an office and when i arrived they have it was sealed
and they have to open it i was in the company of my brother he was also
working in the library at the very same place they didn’t tell me
anything after reading the letter they have to tell me that i have to go
because i am a terrorist they after clapping they clapped me and told
me that i had to leave the place because i am a terrorist from there
they told me to come and collect my money the following week
	i went to collect the money at the end of the month it was just some
few rands and i took the money and went to pretoria as i was there i
wasn’t free because i was being monitored my movements were monitored
and i have to leave pretoria and go back home that was even there
i wasn’t free at home because some people were following me the criminal
investigating officers were around trying to trace my whereabouts and my
thank you samson you you’ve given us quite a comprehensive
statement and you’ve also given us quite a detailed account now so i’m
not gonna ask you too many questions but one thing which is still not
clear is why why were they so interested in you you don’t you you
mention that they asked you about certain well know political figures
like peter nchabalengo we know actually who died in a police cell
during interrogation and detention in fact that was one of the cases
that we heard when were in in pietersberg but why you what were you an
activist did you belong to organizations that doesn’t come out very
i can say that early june during the uprisings we we
used to meet with people from young guys from soweto and they they have
to come to our homes and we had to sit down and discuss politics some
times we didn’t know that amongst us there might have been spies who
were information and giving them to the security forces i was surprised
when i got arrested in i was arrested on the way when i went
further trying to investigate as to why i have to go to petro mekato
they said maybe it’s because they hate the things that we discuss and
someone might be taking the information and giving over to the police i
think our problem was that we were so eager to gain to know more about
politics and anything about politics in afrikaans and the intimidation by
the old system in our education
in your statement you speak about thinking about going to join
unkontowesiswe going into political exile was this something that was
part of those discussions that that you have just now referred to 
that that you that you’d indicated in these discussions that you were
perhaps thinking of going to join mk
i would say early i realized that this thing of
staying around here with police following me isn’t a good thing so i have
to cross the country and fight as a nation soldier to defend my people
but you didn’t go into exile 
yes i did go to exile
when did you when did you leave 
and then the interest of the security police in you continued
after i came back when i tried to find out whether they
used to come i was told that they used to come in i left the place
and went to pretoria in i started working at a place which was a
contract employment in august i worked at the indistinct
can you just tell us a bit about what happened between the time
that you left end of ‘ and when you came back did you actually go
we went to some military training and we just to go and
learn more about politics at in bulgaria when we had to learn a lot
about communism economics and many other subjects
so you came back into the country as a member of the underground
then as a member of mk when you when you came back 
i operated as an underground agent yes
now these people who they asked you about did you have did
you just know about them or did you have contact with them like peter
i don’t have any information about them and i didn’t have
that much link i didn’t meet them that often i would say that in our
area in skukune since there were uprisings and there were anc
people there and that’s i think that’s the reason why they would go
around searching for people like me or people who know much about the
senior leaders like peter nchabalenge and mr diyale
just one last question the torture that you were subjected to
has it left any longterm have there been longterm consequences what
what effect has it had on you in the in in the long term do you think 
i don’t understand the question clearly
the torture that you were subjected to because you speak about
being quite severely tortured what have the results of this torture been
in the long term are you still affected by it do you still feel
traumatized by it has it affected your health in any way 
i would say that before i had the problem that they’ve
broken my teeth when i was out normally the air will enter into the
teeth cavities and it was painful i had a i didn’t get a chance to get
them refilled and somewhere in to ‘ i managed to get them
refilled i’m not really sure but i didn’t have any problems i’m i’m
not sure about the future when i get forty how how i will be
samson what are you doing at the moment 
i am a priest at the moment
how many children do you have 
samson i would like to to take you back you said when they
came to arrest you while doing a road work what year was that 
during that year if i understand you well they asked
you about people pala pinta peter nchabaleng chuganuga is that true 
yes that’s correct they asked me about these people
can you explain further at the moment chuganuga was in
as much as i know in politics at the time while they were
investigating about this they wanted to know whether the children at
skukuna have information about anc politics about the anc strategies to
pull down to bring down the government
the way you explain it looks like they just picked you up 
i would say yes that happened i was so surprised too
because they didn’t ask me much about the information that they have
they only me ask me about these people whether i know them or not and i
told them that i don’t know these people
at that moment were were you actively involved in politics
or some relatives who were actively involved or who could brief you about
to say about my family i would say i had family members
they didn’t tell me much but at school we had teachers who taught us much
about politics and they were some of them were members of saso one of
them whom i know at the time was stanley mogoba and brothers of my mother
what did you know about stanley mogoba at that time 
we knew stanley mogoba as a person who was imprisoned
because his of his political involvement but we didn’t know much about
at the time where was stanley 
if i remember well he was in jail at that time if i
remember well it looks like he was
he was in a seminar and he was training to be a priest or
let’s leave that behind and go forth this time in how long was it
since these people tata chabeling and others came back how long was it
from the time they came from prison 
i won’t know much about that because what i know is that
these people were arrested and i didn’t have any close link with them
let’s leave that too you said from there you got some work
i worked at berco driegoed in pretoria and silverton
what kind of work were you doing 
didn’t you at any time in your life join the south african
defence force i heard that you might have joined the force
i didn’t join any of the departs security department under
the national government i just i just worked as an ordinary me member
you said that you went into exile in and came back in
yes i went on and came back june
is it true you went out 
i went to exile in i came back in june
when you came back what kind of operation were you doing as
i didn’t do anything i just stayed at home and i just
i have no further questions i just want to remind ourselves
that in when your first arrest took place and the torture that you
underwent and the subsequent going into exile you were only sixteen
right sixteen seventeen thousands of our youth face the
same situation as you leaving their homes leaving their families often
leaving their education and going into exile the chairperson of our
commission has said many times that the democracy that we are in now has
had a heavy price and the heavy price having been paid by by our by our
country but mostly by the youth of our country must be recognized we
are planning throughout the country for offices of the commission to have
a special hearing on children and youth in june where we want to
actually highlight and identify not only what the the commitment and the
sacrifices that youth made but also the problems that have aminated from
this i think what that’s one of the challenges of our new democracy as
to how do we move from a country where in the ’s youth actually became
militarized to now move in into a country where we we develop and
respect new values and i hope that you coming here today again has
identified to us and to the community at large the price that you people
paid thank you very much for coming

messina the commissioners from the trc other staff members from the
trc media members from the saps and sandf fellow councillors and
members from the public it is my greatest honour and pleasure as mayor
to welcome you all the role of the trc in terms of facilitating the
process of reconciliation in our country is most welcomed we all
understand and agree that miracles happened when the new democracy was
ushered by the elections of and subsequent local government
elections of but we equally agree that we need to go through a
process of reconciliation so that the atrocities of the past can be said
and forgotten messina as it is a border town was used as a passage by
cadres to come in and out of the country and we hope the coming here of
the trc will be able to unearth and try to assist on a number of
unresolved issues in terms of persons who went missing during those
years the problems of land mines which were placed in our various farms
is an issue which we also need to address the victims of those land
mines they need to come forward and as a community as a nation we need
to recognize and agree and finally we need to forget the past and move
forward to together the trc will go a long way to assist the victims of
those land mines which were planted in our border and also in our farms
so that at the end of the day there will be peace and reconciliation
the unbannings of the organizations in february opened a way in
messina and also in the country in general where civic organizations
political organizations mushroomed that process also happened in
messina as civic leaders then we organized campaigns and the
compainers the campaigns which we organized mass actions strikes stay
away’s consumer boycotts and marches they were problems which our
	the previous government used all machinery which was open at their
disposal to deal with the upcoming of the civic committees people were
detained people were tortured and others got killed out of the actions
which were organized during those days and our belief is that the coming
of the trc will go a long way to eleviate the problems and the concerns
where the victims of those actions which were organized at the civic
movement suffered the trc will go a long way to assist that the
perpetrators of those actions will come forward and indicate to our
people and indicate to the country in general that they are sorry and
they need to be forgiven in conclusion i would like to indicate that we
all recognize the fact that the elections the miracles that are that is
happening in our country need to be taken forward in the sense that we
need to recognize the atrocities of the past and while we do that we
need to come forward and indicate as perpetrators and as victims we need
to come forward and accept what the perpetrators will be asking that
will go a long way to heal the wound to heal the wounds in messina in
particular and also in our country in general and with these few words i
would like to encourage all those who are going to give statements to be
free to be fluent and also to explain what they suffered and the
perpetrators if they are here i would like to encourage them as mayor
of this town to take the explanation from the victims and accept and ask
for forgiveness that is why the truth commission is here and at the end
of the day we are going to hold hands we are going to build one nation
we are going to build this country and we are going to take forward the
miracle that have been ushered by the new democracy forward i’d like to

mr tom manthata who is a member of the reparations and rehabilitation’s
committee and mr manthata is also from the johnnesburg office next to me
is dr russell ally who is a member of the human rights violations
committee also from johannesburg and my name is dr fazel randera i’m
also a member of the human rights violations committee based in
	i just want to take up a few points that that the mayor mentioned
clearly as we gather statements we have the difficult task of deciding
who should come to a public hearing if my memory serves me right we
have about fifty statements from messina so far and of those we had to
take thirteen or fourteen and i want to take the opportunity to say to
those people who are not going to be making a statement here today that
your statement is as important as everybody else’s statement that the
same energy will be given to corroborating what you have said in your
statement that will help us make a finding as far as the process of the
we also want to say that if we look at the mandate of the truth and
reconciliation commission our responsibly is to try and develop as
complete a picture of what happened in this area which contributed to
these gross human rights violations and the act is quite clear as to what
the gross human rights violation is and it’s defined as as as a
killing an abduction torture or severe illtreatment the mayor
mentioned the land mines that’s that were set off and and my reading of
the history of this area tells me that in particularly a
number of people were killed and severely injured from those land mine
explosions now we tried on a number of occasions to contact some of the
family members of the individuals who were who are still alive from
these incidents to try and see whether they would be willing to make
statements for different reasons people were not willing to make
statements and again i would i would appeal to those people to come
forward and make a statement if it’s still possible for them to do so
messina also is an area that clearly saw a number of young people
especially post leave the country to go and join the liberation
movement in exile and i’m sure many people in in these communities
played a role in assisting these individuals as they as they passed
through messina now today you will hear some of that but again we have
not had enough people coming forward to make statements so again our
message is clear please in order for us first of all to give you the
opportunity to make you statement please come forward and secondly in
order for us to develop as complete a picture as possible please come

mr manthata welcome and thank you for coming i can see from
your statement that you were one of the older residents of of this area
and that you have a long history of involvement and understanding i see
you give your date of birth as july so there’s obviously a long
involvement and rich experience and what you’re going to really speak
about is is how because of the political views which which you held
you were victimized from early on but you’re going to be speaking about
particular events and which led to an attempted banishment and the
effects that this had on you so i’m going to ask you if you will please
just give us an account of of of these experiences which you have told
i came hear to tell you about something which disturbed me
very much it was said before and i was called by the police and i was
asked about the letter which i didn’t know about i did tell them that i
did not know anything about that letter and i think the letter was
telling about something which happened in messina when i was writing the
letter i think i wrote my name there and my address so that anybody who
wanted to see me could find me easily mr klopper told me that one old
woman came to see him and he told me that i was the person that wrote the
letter and i said no i did not know the letter they left me for a long
time and in i was called again when i was called the man who
called me was called strydom he was a senior man who had many
epaulettes he came in with mr thelele and after he called my name he
said who’s manthata and i said that’s me he said you must know that
here i arrest people and if i arrest you i also send them to mr mandela
in robben island and i said you can do that to me when we got inside the
house and after that he told me he took out a letter in his hand he
said do you know this letter and i said sir i do not know that
letter and i don’t want to talk about something i don’t know then he
therefore took out that letter and he brought out that letter he said
do you know the law when i spoke to him i said i don’t know the law
and then he stood up i’m going to call klopper and then he went out to
call klopper and he came to me he says this person says he doesn’t know
the law klopper also could not tell me that his story and after that
they said to me you say you don’t know law and he said he was going to
form an agenda and another man came and brought the law book and i asked
him if he could borrow me this law so that i could understand my rights
and he refused i then requested that book again and also the interpreter
told him he was the interpreter for klopper and they said this man has
spoken a lot and thereafter in another day when we formed the advisory
board he brought this book again and i said to him borrow me this book
and he refused and i said if this person is refusing to give you this
book would you take it by force that’s how things were and now and
that gentleman or he is the one who asked klopper and thereafter i said i
bring the evidence i said i like klopper i do not want to hide
anything i’d like to speak the truth when i said i like him because
he came to my house and he took he told that guy and he agreed and he
gave me a dove and i again gave him a present as a dove and he took it
to his home he came back to my house again and i gave him a chicken as a
present and he took it to his home again i asked him if he liked it he
said yes and i really to asked him if i was a bad person would i really
give him a present why would i do that
	then the this guy who was sent from pietersberg who was known as
strydom in pietersberg i’m not sure about the name this guy came to me
and he told me that he understood my story and he told me that he’ll try
to go and tell his seniors what surprised me was that this guy was not
taking any statements down and i suspected that he was the person who was
not delivering the messages properly he said to me i could go home and
mr manthata one of the events that you you speak about in your
statement which you say led to this in attention the police being
interested in you and questioning you was a strike that you speak about
at a at the messina mining fields that’s what you say in your
statement i was involved in a strike at messina mining fields and this
is round about could you just tell us a little bit about this
strike and and what the what the consequences of this strike were 
that strike was we formed we started striking at the
mining fields in major john our manager i was in cambell mine he
told the employees that when we we must take our tickets to him so that
he can give us money so he started not giving people money even if they
submitted the tickets to him he ignored the employees and people got
angry and took all their tickets back to his office later the people
realized that this man was ignoring them they were people from
njasaland they went aside to have a caucus and they discussed they
decided that they were not going to work the following day we boycotted
the following day and these people decided that they would beat anybody
who was going to work that day most people didn’t go to work that day
and later we were sitting outside people were called to the camp and
some men came to us and one of the guys was was one of those who we were
told that he was beating people up in pretoria he came with lots of men
and they started arresting people one of the policemen came to me and
looked at at me but he he’d he ignored me later
	later when they were arresting people our big boss he was was ignoring
me because i used to disturb him a lot and shout to him because he he
didn’t want me next to him he actually wanted to arrest me he wanted me
to be arrested god told me that i must leave that place immediately i
left and later on they were arresting everybody they arrested about a
hundred people and they took them to louis trichardt
	there was a man called alfuous madiba he was a communist he was a real
communist he came to us with other three men in and they were
telling us about politics later when we were discussing this matters
alfuous when he arrived late he told me that he tried to ask for a lift
from those men they couldn’t give us a lift he asked me where where
did these people go to and i told him that they were arrested they were
taken to louis trichardt and he said he’ll go there to see them
actually major john when he wanted to arrest me he read something on
guardian and he wanted me to get arrested because i said something on
that newspaper and he asked me at some stage that where was i taking all
those newspapers and i told him they were not mine they were from dan
and it i did do it they did not belong to me that’s how he started to
hate me alfuous went there to to to buy food and bread for those
people who were arrested this alfuous madiba is late i actually don’t
know where he ended up thank you
thank you mr manthata just just one last question and if you
could just very briefly tell us a a little bit about your involvement in
what describe as the messina advisory board and you say that this also
let to the police focusing their attention on you visiting your house
threatening to arrest you can you tell us about this messina advisory
board what it did and and what your role in it was 
i was a member of the advisory board as i was a member of
the advisory board i was leading the god’s nation i didn’t want the
god’s nation to be misled i wanted them to have a true life the men i
used to work with they were not good people to me they used to fight me
and they used to report me to the detectives and they reported that i was
a communist when they said i was a communist it was then that the
sergeant started searching me and took all my papers but they didn’t get
anything they didn’t get anything the second time when he came with
another sergeant sergeant heys when he came to me they searched again
they searched they took some papers that were written sesotho but they
couldn’t read in sesotho they took those papers and said we’re going to
take them away and ask them to read them ahead and we’ll bring them back
to you later on after that the detectives came there were lots of
detectives who came i saw a lot of people coming to my house and they
said they were detectives and they were and they searching and they came
to me they said they’d come to search and i said go ahead and search
when they came they were with i think it’s mr morotoba when they
searched they had a stick which they were sticking the papers with and i
had put it away and he said is this thing for holding a gun i said
no i’m not involved in those kind of things but they continued to
search they failed because they didn’t find anything they were fighting
with me and they said i was not telling the truth and i was telling the
truth and i was prepared to fight for the truth and to die for the god’s
nation i cannot just do anything for myself i was working for the god’s
nation and they said i must speak the truth thank you
thank you very much mr manthata that’s all
mr manthata when you were banned and you said you didn’t
want to leave what happened and when you refused to go when you were
banished what did they say to you 
at that time there was an officer which i really didn’t
like when he came to visit people they wouldn’t even great him
according to the old law and now it was the difficulty that i face from
those white people because at times they would fight me there’s a
child who came to me who said who want whom i wanted to register they
refused to register my child other people used to be able to register
their children but with me they were fighting me because of the truth
i didn’t want them to trouble other people and it was very very
difficult they wanted to banish me to chase me away but they failed
when i came here in messina i came in messina in i was only about
twelve years yes i was about twelve years i came when i was a very
young boy and i didn’t even have a home when i came here in messina now
these foreigners came to harass me auret and auret didn’t want to allow
people here and this police came to me and the office people are the ones
who used to harass me but because of god they eventually had to give up
some of them went away some of them died and some of them are still
alive but god is still keeping me alive to be on earth thank you
commission n’tate you spoke about a letter when you
started what did this letter say 
witness i do not know what this letter said i wouldn’t
know because i didn’t say they must write this letter to me but they just
produced this letter and said here is the letter i said i did not want
to be involved in this letter because i didn’t write the letter and i
had never written any letter if i write a letter i write my own name
and write the address but that letter i didn’t know where it had come
from and i told them i didn’t know that letter so he took that letter
straight and took that letter and he folded it and put it in his pocket
commission so they didn’t read this letter to you 
witness no they didn’t read this letter to me it was
their secret that they were trying to trick me with but they failed
because they were saying i was teaching people it’s only teachers who
teach children to read but i also taught the people the truth what was
commission during that time when you were a member of the
advisory board what were you doing for people 
witness i used to do a lot of things god advised me to
help these people that is why i’m still alive today and all most of
those people are dead but i’m still alive but i think god put me there to
solve the problems that people had and that they must have a better life
commission what were the problems that the messina people
witness there were lots and lots of problems we used to
fight when the compound people who used to come to nancefield they used
to give them little papers instructing them what to do and if they didn’t
have these papers the police would would arrest them so we fought
that that when people go ho go to their homes or go to nancefield they
shouldn’t be given permits so we used to tell those people we told them
we no longer want this little pieces of papers and permits so we helped
those compound people quite a lot in nancefield there were lots of
problems sometimes people would come there before o’clock there would
be police all over there with the dogs they would let the dogs on people
to bite them i don’t know that time i was still as escort when i was
acting escort they brought a person from munjasa who was bitten by a dog
and my heart was very sore i then realized that they were very cruel to
people they used to let dogs on people to be bitten by dogs there were
a lot of people who were bitten by dogs and i said to nancefield and
messina people they will not tell the truth it was scared i don’t know
why are those people scared because i think we must go ahead and those
who want to stay behind will stay behind
commission if you could just answer briefly where you
witness yes i was arrested they said i wasn’t working
it was because of the advisory board i was very active in the advisory
board but i wasn’t employed and my sister’s child was working at the
office so they said this person must earn pension in that’s when
i earned a pension and then those problems that i have eventually were
mr manthata just a few more questions this nancefield
advisory board that you’re talking about was it an organization that
came out of the people or was it something that was created by the local
this advisory board before this advisory board we had a
residents association with another man we established this and with a
another man who was a reverend in the gospel church and i realized that
this man was powerful when we started this job together we used to fight
these things together and other elderly people joined this residents
association and then they agreed with us and they were by us so that they
would solve all those many problem after that this advisory board was
only established much later in it was in november that’s when the
advisory board started before it there was no white person there were
only black people and mr goosen was the first to be the superintendent of
so it was set up by by the council in this area rather than
from the community itself am i right 
we used to advise the god’s nation
can you tell me this question of banishment did that happen
to other members of the advisory board as well or was it only you and a
i didn’t understand well your question
if you were asked by mr klopper to come in and told to leave
messina was that happening did that happen to other members of the
advisory board or was it only to you 
it was me it was especially me i could say it was only me
and other people must speak for themselves this advisory board he used
to have criminals who were working for white people because i used to
crossquestion them i would ask questions to white people i would i
would then have to find out from them before i could treat them because
i wanted to understand their question or i mean i wanted to understand
where they came from and what was their backgrounds so i would ask and
then i would have now trap them when they answered me that’s how i used
to treat them so these other people were fighting me because if you
want to talk about issues you used to ask questions said no that’s
how god gave me because i used to trap them i used to trap them
completely and then i would explain to them and say these are the issues
and they couldn’t go ahead the couldn’t give me any answers
mr manthata was it common in those days we’re talking about
 now was it common in those days where if the police or other
members of authority did not like what what others were doing they
would just banish them to some other area 
in the nancefield community the nancefield municipal boss
before this committee was established it was started by the health
committee the chairperson was an elderly person who was mr gemeri who
used to be the owner of the mine after that there was this advisory
board there were three people who used to be elected by the community
i’m sure you you can you in pretoria can search and find who these
people were but others were appointed by the white people by the
municipal people and these are the three people those are the people who
used to fight me those who were appointed by the municipal they were
just like real big issues because god gave me life they didn’t succeed
others even used to go to witch doctors to fight against me and i wanted
i asked which doctor would would make this person mad that’s what they
were trying to do to make me mad but other people used to come and
report this thing to me and eventually managed to make me mad in but
god helped me they did not succeed and my ancestors also helped me so
they didn’t succeed to make me mad old people said i was very clear in
what i was saying and at later on at the station the the black toilet
was in a bad condition there was a waiting room and i went to the other
waiting room and and then they built a better waiting room at the
station at at the platform when i arrived at the platform and then
they asked then i they built this platform station platform because i
told them that the other people are disabled they couldn’t get into the
train if there was no platform and the hospital there were metal beds
that people couldn’t use them properly and i said there must be beds that
were in good condition sick people could not sleep on beds that were in
bad condition and indeed they did provide some new beds for the hospital
and this wa by mr katz who was our chairman they sold the old beds at
r tape ended three coaches and the whites had their own coach and
we black people were not allowed to get into the other coaches for the
white people and i was together with another man and we were waiting
there and this other old man said get inside get inside you can’t have
this young boy get in i said sit down and not sit down let us get in
and this old man said i’m not talking to you i said whoever you’re
speaking to you’re also speaking to me because i’m also a black person
that white man called me and there were lots of white men around me and
they wanted to question me when i got into the room they said to me
alfuous and i said sir and he he said to me do you know that there is a
person who must control all these people and he said to me next time
when there’s there’s a problem you must come to me you must not talk to
anybody else you must come and report things to me he went to report me
to his senior and they discussed about me and there were other white
people who were favouring black people but others hated us and they
discussed and they come up with the decision that black people should use
three coaches and the white people two and they said to me they read in
a paper and they informed people that they will prepare three coaches for
black people and two for whites and they did arrange that
mr manthata thank you mr manthata i have no further
questions thank you for coming here today to to help us understand
what happened to you and what happened in this area in that in that
particular period that you’re talking about i must say that despite all
the difficulties that and the experiences you’ve had age has treated
you very well i’m mean for a ninety almost a ninety year old young man
you are doing extremely well thank you very much for coming today
thank you for coming can you please introduce the gentleman
it’s pastor umadamarrah who’s my cousin
good afternoon to you pastor miss moleya will you please
stand to take the oath joyce
thank you i hope you are relaxed you are at home pheule
can you please tell us about the killing of wilson
yes it was on the tenth of march it was on saturday
there on the road there were noise which were taking place there then
we were sitting at home with my mother after that we saw police van
passing by the villages after passing by of that car we heard a gunshot
that gunshot let us to flew to our house and wilson was not in the
present in the family shortly after that we heard someone coming running
and we thought it’s him while that child was running he was asking for
the mother of wisd room was on the road side and then i answered no i’m
not the mother of wisda i’m his sister and he asked me to follow her in
the road they’ve shot wilson then i went out to before my mother my
mother was crying saying oh my child might have died then i ran
following that gentleman who came then i went to that place i find that
he was no longer there where he was shot he was taken out from scene by
other boys and they were taken to a certain principal who’s called mr
mabela asking the principal to rush him to the hospital
	n arriving there i found that he was shot dead for me to talk to him
was difficult because he was unable to talk and then the principal mr
mabela took us to the hospital there at the hospital my mother arrived
and they told us they were they were waiting for the doctor then doctor
van zyl arrived and doctor van zyl did not tell us anything but he just
ordered us to take him to the mortuary then the workers there took him
	it ended like that he was buried his buried burial i’m not sure if
my mother buried her but in in fact he was buried by the messina
community and so after his burial a certain white man came who was
called pretorius then pretorius asked told us that the case of your son
will come forward and my mother asked no how can it come forward
because i don’t know the one who shot him then they if my mother was
still alive i think my mother she’d bwe the one who will be giving
	after the funeral we took it as if that was the end of the story but
after that we find the letters coming that we informing us that we are
needed in court there in court my mother was not allowed to enter the
court to hear the case of her son subsequent to that the case was
remanded to june that was in 
	in again the my mother was barred from entering the case well i
might not say the the right name mr ntai was responsible for the case
after that we were told that all the people involved with the victims
were seen and we would like to address this to the mother that we are not
going to show you who the kill who killed the son we are still taking
these documents to pretoria for further investigation on who killed him
	even up to today we are still waiting for the response unfortunately
my mother died in and we buried my mother before she could actually
know how her son died and who killed him
at the time of wilson’s death how long sorry my question
is what about the father was your father dead already by that time
no the father is still alive they were not staying together
then but he was working in town soso well murewa matsaung the
reverend came to our place just to investigate to find out who the
father of the child was and the mother said she didn’t know exactly what
kind of job the father was doing so it went to the media or press the
my stepfather wilson nedambale just learnt about it on the newspaper
because no he couldn’t be able to read about the cases which took place
here in messina that is when he came down to bury the son
and before the mother died she had not told ntai that there
would be a father who could take over the responsibility of of the death
of the son about the case concerning the son
no i don’t know exactly because my mother was the one who
used to contact some elderly people because no then i was not staying
with them at the same place
when you heard about the death of wilson and you jumped up
who did you meet who could have told you about the shooting or the shot
well nobody really contacted us we just expected that the
pretorian people would be investigating documents and after that we will
be able to know who killed wilson
would you say wilson was in the march at the time
well the march is a separate case it wasn’t during the time
of the march it was just during the time when the children i mean
school students were just singing in the street some people like
mpumalelo who singing were arrested that was when the case about the car
burning of pops was involved well people never expected such an
accident and the youth who were in the street were the ones involved and
that is when the accident took place
so we’ll say that ntai sorrry you are saying that wilson
was amongst those youths who were dancing or singing around
i definitely very sure of that
and okay you say he was buried by the community of messina
at that time at which school was was wilson
what did the school itself do
there was nothing that the school did they just came to share
some words of condolences and like nothing else
in fact what i meant to say was did the student leadership
at the time claim to know wilson and perhaps his role in the student
there was not even a single incident related to that
so far when last were you in contact with ntai about the
well i’ve never been in contact with wilson i mean ntai
it’s only the old mother of mine when she was still alive we only
learned that there was a meeting and ntai was there and i’m told by the
mother i was told that only the documentation from pretoria will be able
if we suggest that you get in touch with ntai and have the
whole case reviewed would it be a difficult thing to do
that cannot be a difficult thing it’s just that i don’t have
much knowledge on it but it cannot be a difficult thing
thank you mr manthata miss seroke dr ally
ma’am i just want to clear one thing please your statement
dates it as our research document talks about can we just be
sure which year it took place in
you mean the shooting it was march on a saturday
can you just describe to us or tell us what actually happened
after the death of wilson you talked about the community taking
responsibility for the funeral were there other demands that were also
made by the community after that
well i’m afraid i can lie i don’t have the real answer there
i have no further questions is there anything else you wish
well i cannot add anything so far thank you
pheule i just want to go through what what we understand of
what happened at that time and perhaps you can add or subtract our
research tells that there was there was mass protests against the
continuing existence of of black local authorities at the time and of
course the youth and residents were asking for the resignation of
councillors in messina this was a trend that we have seen in other parts
of the country as well the death of wilson of course led to the launch
of a consumer boycott and a stayaway which lasted almost a week we
understand that even white businesses were forced to put pressure on
black councillors to resign these events coincided with the formation of
the messina civic organization at the beginning of the ’s and of
course other mass campaigns were launched including the value added tax
that we heard of earlier on and this was done in conjunction with cosatu
as we’ve seen in other places of course all these actions let to more
arrests and to more killings and more injuries so i’m not saying that
we’re not listening to what you’re saying about wilson’s death wilson’s
death of course appeared to trigger off a number of events in in messina
and nancefield thank you very much for coming to speak to us today and
we will come back to you
can i call tshalo moraba mr moraba good afternoon can you
please introduce the person who is with you
can you please stand to take the oath please joyce
mr manthata will you take over
could you excuse the interpreters the mike is not on mr
manthata’s mike is not on thank you
could you briefly relate to us when you were arrested and
why you were arrested and tell us everything that happened
i was arrested in they were suspecting that i’m one of
the people who had burnt down mr pop’s house what had actually happened
was that i was offloading the beer truck in mr scheepers’s bottle store
there was a smoke it was almost like a two kilometers away that’s when
we saw the smoke going up we got on top of a big truck and we looked
further away where there was smoke and we could see that the burn the
house that was burnt was mr pops’ house and on the very same night the
police came and they were together with the soldiers they came in a
hippo they came to arrest us we were forcefully taken away they didn’t
even explain anything they just put all of us on top of the hippo it
was me and my brother but now my brother is not here he’s in town but i
could see recognize other boers were there it was a it was abe
middelkamp who and mr van niekerk and durandt
they took us to a firm which is called embarren i don’t know what was
known for it wasn’t yet developed at that stage and from there there
were citi golfs they were private cars these citi golfs that’s where
they covered our heads like when they were hanging a person the kind of
things that they would put on top of the person that they hang so that
we would not see where we were being taken to it was i and my brother
baldwin and mandaho there were also other people who had been arrested
but we were all separated into these citi golfs and they took us but
through my cover the sack that they put me i could see a bit it
wasn’t it was a bit visible it wasn’t very dark from there we were
taken to some farms on that side but i don’t know the place but when i
explained to my brother what kind of a farm he knew who’s farm it was
that where we were taken to and then we were taken off the cars from the
there was something made of wood there it was something like the kind of
thing that will grip the hook that will grip the sheeps and then they
put me on top of that thing and they were still had this thing covering
my head and i also heard a chain and they pulled up this chain pulled it
up high up and they climbed up on a ladder and they came to beat me up
on that ladder even at that stage they’d not explained to me why they
were beating me up but they started beating me up and they said i must
tell the truth but they wouldn’t even give me the chance to speak but
they were beating me up say i must speak the truth and i said to them
i’ll speak the truth but i didn’t even know what truth i would speak i
just wanted them to let me go and i wanted to understand why they were
beating me up and then they released the thing and said speak and i said
to them please tell me why you’re beating me up and why have you
brought me up here and they said you know what you did last night to
them tonight i said yes what did you do they said you burnt down mr
pop’s house and i said who were there and at that time when mr pop’s
house was burnt i was not even present during the burning of the house
i was offloading beers 	and that was the time my uncle the late chipa
had died and that’s why those people burnt down mr pop’s house and
because they said pops is the one who had killed my uncle chipa but i was
beaten up and they press me down up until i fainted i was beaten all
over and when i came around and i got up they said speak the truth and
eventually i was forced to just give them the names of people i knew but
i didn’t know if those people were involved in burning down the house i
just started speaking all the names i knew and i used i told them the
names of the police of the policemen children thereafter they released
me and i was very powerless i didn’t have strength they took us and
took us i think it’s to sanlam i think that’s the police office there
from there we didn’t sleep we were taken to louis trichardt at the
parking and i think it was about four o’clock that time when we arrived
at the parking there were some taxis and there were also a lot of other
people who had been arrested like pumzele masiti baldwin iglet and i
cannot remember others but there were a lot of us there but they didn’t
want me to get of the citi golf to be with other people they kept me
alone because they while we were still at louis they discovered that
those people had been arrested were the policemen children so they ar
released them and they let them go
	from there they repeated the things again and they then they said to
me you knew who’d burnt down the house and i knew i had not done
anything even if they’d beat me up i kept on telling them that whatever
they’re forcing me to say it will be lies because i could not force
myself to say something i didn’t know there was another boer there but i
don’t know his name i but they were boers from pietersberg and louis
trichardt they were all together but the only people i knew were the
ones the three name i told i knew so then they came and asked me
barend sty strydom they if i knew him i said yes i know barend
strydom they said yes he killed sixteen kaffirs because i was also
annoyed i asked them if they knew mtetelele and zondele they said
they didn’t want to talk about nonsense i said today you will see i
asked them about the rooinekkers and it was not the only ones so they
got angry and took me away there was a captain and a they put me in
front of a taxi and kicked me all over and from there and they bought
food and this time we’d not eaten but they bought the food and ate it
themselves and the leftovers they gave them to us but i refused to eat
and my friends whom i was with had been arrested with they ate the the
leftovers but i was so angry i couldn’t eat and i was angry because i’d
been arrested being innocent and being tortured
and from there they realized that i was very cheeky they took me to the
louis trichardt police station they first asked me questions i don’t
know who this person was with it was a cid but it was a white person he
said to me i must make a statement he wasn’t requesting me to told me a
statement he was ordering me to make a statement and he said explain
so i explained the very same thing that i’d explained before and after
when i finished my story they said that’s shit and he folded he said
now tell me the true statement of how you burnt down the house the main
thing that they wanted was that i accept or acknowledge that i bunt the
house even though i did not so that they could find me guilty that was
the only thing that they wanted from me from there they realized that
they were failing so they tied me with irons and burnt me and they put
another metal and hung it on top and they put electric wires around me
around my hands with a masking tape and they started shocking me with
electricity and then i fainted i did faint there when they were shocking
	from there they took us to pietersberg the other people didn’t know
what was happening to them at that stage i was very confused i didn’t
know what was happening things were very tough for me well they took
us to pietersberg and others were dispersed and taken to other different
places but i i can’t remember the names of pl places but i do know the
place i think i stayed there for about three days or a week i wasn’t
eating since they’d arrested i was not eating anything i think they got
scared about that and eventually they took me back to the trial and from
there they started begging me and asking me what i wanted and they
promised that they would buy anything that i requested and they said this
government’s money i must just request anything i wanted i didn’t make
any requests from them but they bought cigar and magew and other things
and gave them to my brother baldwin my brother was eating and then we
	we came to the trial here in messina from there there was mr cj
bester who was the prosecutor of the magistrate excuse me he postponed
the case remanded the case and i requested dole for a free bail i also
wanted to press the charges against the people who were beating me up and
he said to me he’ll call incatha to come and discipline me he said he’ll
call incatha with knopkierries to come and discipline me and he ss
talked quite a lot and some of the things he said i cannot remember
them it was in that time then the issues were were actually exposed in
the sowetan newspapers we did get the free bail through the lawyers and
eventually i was discharged nothing went ahead of the case but i was
very angry why they refused me to press charges against them because they
abused my life wrongly this is why i have come here to the truth
commission so that i could relate this
who is this pops who’s house was burnt down and it was
they when teachers were dying they were blaming him for those
deaths that’s why his house was burnt down my uncle chipa too was also
suspected to be it was suspected that my uncle was killed by this pops
are you telling us that these teachers who were killed were
no they were not politically involved the community was
concerned that the teachers were dying at the time and also the student
were concerned that who was going to teach them i’m not the one who’s
saying that what i’m saying is what was done and said by the community
but i myself i’m not saying so
thank you can we settle down please
i actually want to understand here are you saying the
teachers students and the community were thinking that teachers were
dying because of political their involvement in politics
the community here in messina is is united if there’s
anything which causes pain in the community they would get together
discuss it and try to fight that problem
this pops who was a a witchdoctor how was his his his
being a witchdoctor related to politics
i can’t explain that because i don’t know
at the time were you a student
were you one of the leaders in in the political
how did they relate you to the burning of pops’ house
actually i used to be a victim of of police the police at
the time i thought there was one policeman who hated me an at the time
and and my brother too because everything which used to happened at the
time we had to be invol to be taken and and it was it didn’t happen
many times that if if something was happening we were not taken to the
policeman we were always we would always be taken to the policeman even
if we not involved they will just create stories so that we get involved
were you not members of any political organization at the
i was a member of the anc at the time my brother baldwin was
a member of the pac but that is not the reason i never thought that was
the reason why we should always be involved if there was anything wrong
in in messina and again my brother being a pac i cannot find the
reason why we would always be taken away if there was something wrong
that’s why i’m thinking and i used to think that there was one policeman
i have another question where you not in the leadership of
no i was not i was an ordinary member
is there any other reason that you can it can tell or
explain us which made the police to be after you
before this incident there was one mr ramoba who was a cid who
used to come to our house to come and fetch us he would always take us
was ndo your lawyer and was he a lawyer to the anc or he was
he was the human rights lawyer
how did he relate your incident to politics at the time
i could not meet my lawyer personally so i don’t really know
i think he met our seniors who were concerned about us and why i was
when i ask you these questions moraba it’s because we want
to know and understand things which happened to people because of
politics at the time we are trying to understand why were these people
doing these things to you if we don’t find the relation of what happened
to you with politics it becomes difficult for us to understand what
you’re saying to us is that when you were arrested they asked if you knew
what did you understand at the time when they asked you
what i understood is that they were being racist they were
trying to show us that black people were nothing that’s what i
was it was it how you answered them when they asked you
yes that’s how i answered because it it really disturbed me
and i was angry that’s why i told them because it was painful to be
there was a rumour at the time that there’s this person known
as mteteledi but i didn’t know him at the time i heard that there were
umzondele’s and mteteledi’s who were anc members but i did not know them
i never met them before but i had the courage anyway to tell them that
there were people who were strongly involved with the anc and that i was
thank you i don’t have further questions
i just want to come back to this issue of pops being accused of
practicing witchcraft because this this is not the first time that this
issue comes up and particularly here in the northern province so i wonder
if you could just assist us how did you understand this this this
question of witchcraft and and accusations which were which were made
against people for practicing witchcraft what’s your your understanding
the whole thing of witchcraft i don’t know what to say about
it because this whole thing of burning people because i wasn’t there i
would not be able to answer this question on witchcraft because if i’d
known at first how witchcraft is happening maybe i would also have been
involved in burning the house but because i didn’t know why and what is
witchcraft i did not go there to burn that house so i don’t know
the the three teachers you speak about who you say died
mysteriously do you have any idea how they died what what was the
cause of their of their deaths
no i do not know but what was said was that pops was
responsible but i do not know what killed them but my uncle what i
understood about my uncle is that that guy was after my uncle and
everywhere where my uncle had been he was also involved that was a
rumour but the way he died he died from being knocked over knocked down
by a train but it it was it was a miracle the way he died it was
but you say he died he was knocked down by a train so what
was it was an an an accident presumably what was what was mysterious
or or strange about the way that your that your uncle cause i sure you
know about your uncle’s case what was mysterious or strange about the
i know that my uncle was normal and a normal person cannot
stop the car on the train tracks on the train spoor and seeing that the
train was coming nobody could do that if that person is normal he knew
the normal person has have to stop that train the train would smash
them crush them but that’s why i say it was a bit mysterious that’s how
just to come back to to the person who was commonly known as
as pops you say that he was a petrol attendant what else do you know
about about this person did this person have any political involvement
other than this description of this person as a petrol attendant what
else do you know about him
i only knew him as a petrol attendant but he had a big house
he was a person who wasn’t suffering that’s how i knew him there’s
nothing else i know about him
joseph you are saying your uncle was knocked down by a
and what about these other teachers how did they die
i do not know but one of them was reported to have vomited
blood but i don’t know about others the other one i said he had vomited
blood but i want to remind the truth commission that i did not say pops
is a witch i said there was a rumour that pops is a witch
in your statement you are saying pops drop us the spot where
the accident occurred and was he killed because he didn’t help or i did
when you say your uncle was normal and he could not just stop on the
train spoor don’t you think his car stalls there and stuck there or that
he’d had literally just fetched from the service and when he
came back that’s when that accident happened and the car was still new
and it didn’t have any problem
so the car just mysteriously got stuck there and if a
person sees that the car doesn’t go and the train is approaching wouldn’t
you have opened the car and javoid the train coming to crash into his car
that is exactly the reason i say why it was mysterious because
mr moraba i don’t want you to get the impression that all
these other questions we’re asking you takes away what actually happened
to you the torture that you suffered electric shock treatment punched
kicked and the detention you were that you underwent can i just ask
you what do you do yourself
i am a welder at home i do some welding works at home are
you talking about jobs i do welding at home and carpenting and part of
mechanic those are the things i do
the only other question i have for you is in your statement
you say that at the time of your arrest it was not only the sap the
south african police who were there but also the south african defence
was that common in that time that the south african police
and the sadf actually operated together
yes it wasn’t the first time that if there were such kind of
incidents they would come together with the soldiers it wasn’t the
first time sometimes they used to come with the police and sometimes
when they were arresting people it would be a combined force of the
besides your brother baldwin who was arrested with you
there were other young people who were also arrested can you remember
yes i can still remember their names
and were these all political activists in the in the
were they all political activists in the community
yes they were except my father he was not interested in
thank you very much mr moraba for coming here today we are
going to listen to another person talking about this very incident before
can you please take the oath miss joyce seroke is going to
help you and then mr tom manthata is going to help you in as you tell
your story thank you very much
meriam will you please stand up do you swear that what
you story you’re going to tell is the truth and nothing else but the
truth so help me god would you raise your right hand
you are going to tell us about betty is betty your mother
what are you doing now betty meriam
how many are you at home
how many are working at home
are you still at school i mean at home is there anyone
when your mother got injured was was she working
she was sleeping in a in a room
can you please tell us how did it happen
my mother was sleeping in a room so people were going to the
okay shall we we go back a bit
it wasn’t much de klerk was coming for the campaign here in
messina after there was a gentleman the late auret who was passing by
next to my our village and he saw our village with fire and we were
running to the stadium and that there were an old lady sleeping there
when we were told what was happening we don’t know what happened and then
he entered and then he took it up and said it’s a tear gas and making a
flame and other was in dining room and other in the kitchen the one
which hurt her too much is that one in the bedroom because the the door
of our house faced the stadium so when they threw the teargasses the
teargasses two teargasses went went into their bedroom and the other
one to the kitchen that boy went in and take it out and said it’s the
teargas and don’t be afraid sit down the people who took the teargas
away we did not know them they are the white policemen and they did not
say either sorry or anything because they realized that they made a
mistake and saw that the teargas went into our room and that they did not
tell us anything we were unable to ask anybody that who threw that
teargas into our house we were not away because i was at my other place
left with my mother others were at the stadium when we asked they say
there were whites policemen there were no black police they were white
policemen who were throwing the teargasses that is why we don’t know who
is that even today i do not know the actual person who have done that
and my mother died because of that every month every month april month
she used to to have some teargas infections every month we don’t know
whom to blame and so i’m asking that who have done that who have seen
and who knows the police who have done all those things who were throwing
the interpreters are confused but they the peddie the
i should have asked you in english now that i cannot speak venda fluidly
fluently so i’m sorry yes my question was you did not do you say you
saw the people who threw the teargas into the house
i’ve said then i did not see them they were white policemen
who were escorting and i i did not know them and i cannot say who throw
and when i say did you see them i don’t necessarily say
do you know them i just find you have answered they were white
policemen this is what you are saying and were they throwing the
teargas as they were going to the stadium or they were throwing it from
no they were getting out of the stadium and they were going
you say you were not at the stadium
could you tell us what could have been happening in the
stadium what was taking place in the street
there were so many people flocking to the stadium going to
and were the people going to the stadium marching in an
they were marching in an orderly manner
what would you say the reason was to throw a teargas if it
i’m asking i don’t know why
was it thereafter was it realized that it was your family
only that was affected or could other families nearby have been affected
by the bomb by the teargas
it’s my family only not all the families were affected
i see was your mother ever taken to the doctor
did the doctor tell you what the problem was
she might have the doctor might have told my elder brothers
were there ever letters written by the doctor regarding the
and having discovered or have been having been told that
it was it has affected your mother that much were there ever steps made
to take the instance to the police
and you say for how long has your mother been in that state
by the way so she she is since late
okay no further questions meriam i hand over to the
meriam i just want to clarify the fact about your mother
in your statement you say she is paralyzed on the left side of her body
and just now when you were talking to manthata you said she has since
passed away is she still alive or has she passed away
that was before you made the statement i mean after you had
we’re very sorry about that you did say there was no case
why did you not report the matter to the police
i don’t know why if if you reported this kinds of cases
meriam what happened to your mother is obviously a great
tragedy and we we sympathize with you but there’s just some things in
your statement that i need to to ask you about which which will help us
in in our work cause when mr manthata asked you about this march is it
it was during a march to to protest against de klerk who was coming to
campaign in the area that the teargas cannisters were thrown and landed
in in your house in the family house when mr manthata asked you about
the march you said that it was a peaceful march yet in your statement
when you described those events and i’m going to read what is in your
statement and i want you to just tell us which is the more acurate
account you say in your statement mr de klerk was in messina to canvass
for the elections all the black political organizations in messina
protested throwing stones and the police responded with teargas to
disperse the masses so what actually was happening on that day
actually it was a peaceful march at the stadium you know
that it was right in the stadium but i couldn’t go there physically i
was just out i could be able to see what was happening at the stadium
because it’s very near i was not physically there i did not attend i
didn’t see really what was happening actually
 statement in in your this document that you filled
in about stones being thrown where does where does that come did you
make that statement that stones were actually thrown during this this
i i didn’t see the real person or the persons who threw
also and please just understand that this is in no way about
what happened to your mother we accept that that the teargas canister
was thrown into the into the into the house and this affected your
mother’s health very severely but again back to your statement when you
were giving your oral testimony you seemed to suggest that that the
teargas canister was thrown in by mistake because your house was very
close to the stadium that when the police were dispersing the crowds and
when they were firing these teargas canister you said this went into the
bedroom and into the other room in the house but you seemed to imply that
it was because your house was close to the stadium that’s why that
happened now in your statement when you described what happened you say
that you think that the teargas canisters were thrown into your house
because they knew that anc members stayed in that house and that they
would never vote for de klerk so i would just like you to clarify
because on the one hand you seem to suggest that it was an accident and
that doesn’t take away what happened to your mother but on the other hand
you seem to suggest that this was deliberate and it’s very important for
us to know if we’re going to follow up on on this and do some
investigations so what what do think this actually happened or do you
think your house was targeted that it was deliberate
it could have been an accident because those people in
actual fact were right at the stadium and our house has a door which is
adjacent to the stadium it is quite obvious that when people are
throwing those teargas canisters it could really land in our house
above all it is true that there are a lot of anc members in our house
and they could have done that deliberately because they know that most
of the people that are in my house are not np aligned they are rather anc
aligned that is why i guess they could have done that and well i’m
saying it could have been a mistake too
meriam can you just tell us how old was your mother when she
i just want to get some clarification you say your mother
was paralyzed how soon after the teargas canister was shot into the
she became paralyzed in shortly around july
so that was almost a year after after the day of this
thank you very much i was we’re very sorry to hear of your
mother’s death we’ve listened very carefully to what you’ve said and we
will come back to you in due course thank you for coming today
thank you for coming can you please introduce the person
in the left hand is my husband the on the other on my
good afternoon to both of you and welcome to help me is it
okay if i call you gladys
thank you gladys can you please stand to take the oath if
you can just repeat after me i swear that the story i’m about to tell is
the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
mama tshimbilini you’ve come to tell us about what happened
on the fourteen of february concerning your brother could you just
tell us briefly what happened on that day and why you are here today
thank you for being given the time what happened on the
monday i was at home and i ate within a while i was feeling so tired and
i go to sleep when i was asleep i wake up again and then do the cookings
and when i went to sleep again and then while i asleep i was surprised
to find a policeman coming knocking and then when he knocked my husband
came and they said is this the place of machudo neuvhirwa and they said
we want to go with you to court and my husband refuses and said he can’t
go to sibasa and then i wake up where i was asleep i find that policeman
talking forcing him to go with him and the policeman asked me to go with
him to sibasa and then i refused saying that i don’t know sibasa since i
was here at messina and he forced us that we must go to sibasa and we
asked him why and he said we’ll hear why we are sent called there at in
	from there we stopped there and we were taken to a certain house there
at sibasa and then we were given a chair and then we sat down while we
were seated another policeman came in he took me to the other office
where there were three policewomen there those policewomen asked me my
full names i told them that i’m gladys neuvhirwa then they said okay i
was then taken again to another bench while i was seated another
policeman came in and he took me to another office where there were white
men others were sitting even on top of the table and i was given a chair
to sit while i was seated i was asked whether i know machudo neuvhirwa
then i said i know him so they asked when he disappeared from you and
then i said from sunday o’clock and then they told us that machudo was
with someone and they went to them near a shop called camp and they said
that machudo climbed their store and i said is it they said yes and
they said that there were people who were working for contract there
then when machudo was seeing those tractors machudo was disturbed and
then he fell down and he died and they asked my if there is anything
that i can answer and i told them that what i can answer is this that
machudo climbed the shop i’m not sure and they said they will give me
the evidences they told me that machudo now is dead at half past one
in the afternoon and is dead so i was so tired and i was because he
can’t die without being ill and they told me that he died at half past
one when asking those policemen whether there is something that i can
say i told them that i’ve got something that i want to tell them i i
said i i’m asking them to give me a car to go and fetch the parents of
this robert i went to the parents and then i take jeremino neuvhirwa and
lusino neuvhirwa and then came back with them
	in arriving back on tuesday we were taken to another office where we
were asked if we were parents of the deceased and then we said yes and
they said machudo is dead because he climbed the shop and seeing the
contractors coming next to him he was disturbed and then he fell down
and then the contractors brought him to a police station and then my
father asked to see the constructors and then the police said you will
see constructors during the trials from now nothing is going on one day
while to hear what was happening in the postmorten while we were asking
what was happening because the trial is going nowhere they said we must
go and investigate what’s the case and send the police what’s happening
and then we refused because we thought things were not properly the
police were so angry with me that i never thought i thought i even
thought that this is not a police station while we were at home
policeman mr mathius tjika came in and asked me if i have investigated
the case and i asked them is it true that i must investigate the case
thank you mama tshimbilini i would like to find out when
machudo left on the fourteenth where did you say he was going to
machudo left saying that he’s going to the men’s hostel
where they used to stay there he used to eat food at home and then go to
the nearby hostel when he left he was going to the hostel
was he working at the at the mine there
no he was no longer working the mine was closed
so as a boy i cannot deny because if there were marches he
used to join the other people
he took part in the marches as a member or just somebody who
was just interested a member of the political organization
i agree that he once participated in a certain march that
was the mine march in which he was still working there at the mine
because that was a force for everyone who was in that mine
were you represented at the case did you open a police case
the the case although i was not behind that case because
i was not knowing the people to contact i find that this elder man who
was here at messina mr lerhule came and take and took the statement and
he contacted mr sergeant ntai and ntai came and took me and then i went
there to pietersberg and they asks they told us the case was already
over the trialer had already been held
and you say in your statement that your younger brother had
internal injuries and also was bleeding on his head and how did he
sustain the internal injuries if he’s supposed to have fallen from the
from the roof of the shop into which he was breaking
that he was injured internally it is then that if one is
dead they go for a postmortem and they found that his kidneys were
injured inside his kidneys and while i was still there at sibasa a
certain policeman who said that these police are very scared now and when
other police asked why they said because of this person they killed
so the police were overheard saying that they were scared
that the man had died and he was killed in a cell
yes it is because the police were talking about that
because they were scared because of this person they killed inside the
cell but i was not aware whether my brother’s dead or not
were there any witnesses who could have proved you know
that the police actually did killed this man
as to whether there was a witness in the cell
there was no witness that was in the police cell i knew
that because of policeman mr matika who came and took me and while we i
was there they told me that they are calling me in connection with my
brother machudo because i was not aware that machudo was in police
station that i know that at about half past two when ma policeman mr
do you have the postmortem reports
well the boers who were there in possession of the papers
thank you ms seroke mr manthata 
for how long had machudo been a mine worker
i cannot give the well it was a long time but i don’t
know exactly precisely how long it took
up to the time when he got killed or he died how long had
well he well that was after the mine had closed down and
after the mine after the mind had closed
and this other employment that he got what was he doing at
well i’ll only see him on an machinery section greasing
machines and other things i can’t know exactly what it was all about
so you say that someone said that the police were scared
because machudo had died in the cell do you remember who said that
i’m not sure exactly because i didn’t even know the
policeman i only knew about the policeman in connection with machudo’s
and this other policeman that you are referring to is he
well the two of them matika and masindi are still
and you have never been with them even at this time just to
ask them coolly what is it they know about machudo’s death
honestly those were vicious people that one could never
attempt asking because even if when i look at them i am so frightened
because i know they should have discussed this with me to tell me or to
explain to me as to how it came about but they were so vicious and then
they were threatening me instead of the police looking for the
investigation they asked me to do that
because i’m asking that question because i thought you were
saying there were two groups of the policemen that is the whites and the
blacks so i thought that perhaps the black policemen could have been
approachable you know for this kind of followup but now if i
understand you well you are saying that all the policemen at that police
station were of the same mind with regard to the death of machudo
you say you you didn’t engage a lawyer did i hear you
sorry could you repeat the question please
did you ever engage a lawyer
yes there was a lawyer a certain ntai who was
representing and he was the one who was dealing with this case because
during the time when there had to be a trial mr lerhule asked me to go
to pietersberg and it was explained to me that the trial was connected on
such and such a day we came back with mr lerhule and i was taken from
home to the police station on arriving there we went to one of his
where there was a prosecutor just before we the trial time i was with
mr ntai mr ntai was crossquestioning somebody then although i couldn’t
hear what they were talking about but ntai subsequently told me that the
trial is still on even up to now i haven’t heard anything
oh the the trial is still on and when was that that is
how far back have you been in touch with ntai is it a week is it a
well about two years now well since his promotion he
has never come to me i mean before his promotion since then he’s no
longer contacting me or we are not contacting each other
oh that’s mr ntai he’s not contacting you
yes he is no longer contacting me since he got promoted
because he before he told me that he left somebody to be responsible but
then i don’t even no who is accountable for this case now
have you ever been to ntai’s former office of lawyers to
find out who is running that office now
no i haven’t there i haven’t been to pietersberg
ma’am can i just try and clarify one thing here there’s two
stories one is that machudo could have been killed at the shop and the
other one that he could have been killed in the police cell now this
breakin that the police were talking about where did that take place
well the breakin the involvement of breakin we are
told that he went up on top of the store that was the police information
and i asked the people who were working at the shop as to who broke the
shop or how did it happen and they said they don’t know anything about
it so i was so confused because the police were telling me that he was
on top of the store and he was disturbed and fell down
so the shop owners knew nothing about somebody on the roof
and somebody who had fallen down
well the shop owners seemingly didn’t know anything he
was just shocked to see the vans when the deceased was taken to the
mortuary he was just surprised to see the statement taking place and
when i went to the van matika was driving it i only saw the contractors
who were busy with this man as well i still don’t even know the
contractors who were there i know that it could have been a collation
between the police and the the contractors
i’m sorry can you just clarify again what how the
contractors come into the story who are the contractors
the contractors are the people who were at the camp who
had their tents there we i learnt that they were staying in zimbabwe
it was during the time when they were removing the big pipes which were
responsible for isoling those people after that the contractors if i
told they were having contact with me we could have understood clearly as
to what happened masindi and matika didn’t like me contacting the
contractors that is why when we were coming from venda i saw i realized
that the contractors were no longer in that camp
was the shop in the camp
it was right in the location called kambo oilchem
how old was your brother when he died
i can’t remember so vividly i don’t recall
did he have any children was he married
had your had you brother been ever been arrested by the
police for any other political activity or any other activity before
not at all not a single day he never knew anything about
thank you mama gladys i have no further questions
we thank you to for coming today and and your husband
there’re so many of these stories that we hear of people who got killed
by policemen and often there is no end to to what actually took place
the answers are not there your statement is with the truth commission
we will attempt to find out if there if it’s possible to do so what
happened to your brother and we’ll come back to you thank you very much
can miss nkundlane please come forward miss nkundlane good
thank you for coming you’re also taking us to as well
as another incident that took place where you were also arrested before
i ask you to tell your story can you please stand to take the oath
thank you i’m going to be assisting you as you tell your
story can you just take your time and tell us what happened in 
in was arrested after pops’ car had
been burnt out the car was burnt on thursday night and on friday i went
to school and i came back from school and after school i went to town
when i came back from town and i was just at home i think it was about
two or or and then the police car appeared there was a policeman with
called pietersen tomule he was alone in the car and he came and i was
busy washing the dishes i was with my mom he came in and greeted us and
asked who is porschia i said it’s me he said i’d come to fetch you and
my mother asked why are you taking her where are you taking her to he
and he says in the list of the people who’ve burnt down the car my mom
said what i know is that my child did not do that but if you take her
and killileft with this policeman we also went to fetch somebody
called margaret chipo we also found her at home we also went to
fetch other people they’d arrested all of were arrested were eight they
took us to the police station and at the police station pietersen tomule
said to us you are going to speak the truth we said what truth he
said you know what you’ve done you’ve burnt down the car we said we
didn’t know that he started threatening us and intimidating us i said
you’re going to tell the truth we’re going to show you who we are and we
were scared we got very scared eventually we wanted speak although we
didn’t know what seeing the car but we’d seen some people dispersing
after the car had burnt and we also wanted to say the names of those
people who we saw running away but we eventually said no we don’t know
	they took us to the cells and locked us up in the cells they arrested
us on friday and on saturday in the morning there was a group of
policemen from pietersberg who came i don’t know if they were riot
police but they were wearing khaki uniform they’re very scary they’re
very scary guys i don’t know who to explain them they fetched us from
the cells and the police called ziken mojani was on duty he came to
fetch us and his job was to fetch one by one from the cells to take us to
these other policemen they were sitting somewhere in a private place
they took us one by one and they would look at you in a very threatening
way so that when you start speaking you start talking things you didn’t
know and this ziken mojani said if you arrive there don’t be scared of
anything don’t talk things you didn’t know if you don’t know anything
just tell them you don’t know anything and when i went inside i already
knew what to expect although i was scared and they said is is is it
you porschia nkundlane they said what do you know about the burning of
the car i said i don’t know anything and they started swearing at me
speaking in afrikaans and said to me you’re talking shit and today
you’re going to speak the truth and i said i didn’t know anything they
said when the car was burnt where were you i said i was at home and
they said why did you choose to be there when you when why other
people chose you that you were there when the car’s burning i said i
don’t know if they hated me and they said to me go but you’re still
going to tell us the truth you used to these things you kaffirs and
even the food they brought to us they used to give food to us like they
were giving dogs i have never seen that kind of tea it’s like they were
burning the sugar and then put it inside of hot water and even the food
that we ate sis it was full of maggots and worms and they wouldn’t even
give it to us nicely they will throw it at us but we didn’t eat their
food because the community was there to help us
	the community went to business people and asked for food and brought us
very nice food and on sunday they continued to question us there were a
lot of boer police who used to come and threaten us we were very scared
that they were going to kill us and on monday usually court in messina
it starts at nine but our trial on that day half past seven it was
early in the morning they took us from the cells and we had not even
washed and they pulled us and they were really treating us very badly
illtreating us and pushed us into vans and took us to court in court we
didn’t say anything and they didn’t ask us any questions and when we came
in the magistrate just said our court was remanded i don’t even
remember to what date was it remanded to but it was a far off date i
think it was on a monday and we’d been up and the trial was remanded to
thirtieth of march and there was no bail and there was nothing we were
to remain in custody from there they took us and when we came out we saw
the whole community was there our parents and they were waiting for the
trucks to start in the meantime we’d already been taken in and outside
of the court and the cops took us and threw us into vans and just real
illtreated us one of us hit the cop and kicked the policeman and the
policeman spectacles got broken and they took us to the police stations
from there they took us out of the van and put us in another van to take
us to louis trichardt when they took us they were real not treating us
nicely they were just very rough with us one of the cops had a
knopkierrie when you get out of the van he would hit with the
knopkierrie you’ll be thrown out of the van and get this knopkierrie
hitting and be thrown into another van and they’d push us into this other
van and took us to louis trichardt when we arrived at louis trichardt
it would seem as if there were a lot of people they’d already phoned in
advance before arrived there because we found there were a lot of people
they were expecting us and we were locked into cells
	i think on tuesday very early in the morning i think a prison warder
came and he called us in our names one by one and the guys somebody
went to to to the guys’ cells and we already were to wearing a uniform
awaiting trial uniform and they took us out and they told us that the
messina cops had come back to fetch us again so they took us from louis
trichardt and took us back to messina and they put us again in cells and
much later the human rights lawyer serf serfontein katjalia came and
the trial was going to be at two so they took us to a room in the court
premises and this lawyer spoke to us and said we are here for you don’t
worry and don’t panic and all those things and they also asked us what we
knew about the incident we said we didn’t know anything and the trial
started and then we were all given bail i think it was a group of about
five five hundred rand per person one and the trial started at two
	i think they kept on remanding this case and we used to attend the case
but every time it will be remanded and eventually we were taken to louis
trichardt regional court we went twice and they remanded it and all
those things were costing us it was costing our family to go to louis
trichardt to attend this remanded court hearings and the third time we
went to louis trichardt and and when we were there other people were
charged and others were discharged but what i was really worried about
was to suffer i suffered and i suffered for nothing and there was no
reason for me to suffer and eventually i was discharged because i was
not guilty and that’s why the court discharged me because they saw i
miss nkundlane is is there anything else you want to say
can i just clarify a few issues this incident relating to
pops that you are talking about is that the same as mr moraba was
talking about earlier on because you are dating your incident in and
the burning of a car he’s relating an incident in and and the
yes it is i don’t understand the question
sorry are they two different incidences altogether
okay so this gentleman pops again it seemed like he became
the target in in in the community for some reason his house gets
burnt his car gets burnt he gets accused of of being involved in
witchcraft can you tell us a little more about that
those incidents happened at the time but i don’t as i’m
saying now indicating that i was not there when those things happened i
actually know nothing there’s nothing i can say
in your statement you talk of being part of the anc in
did you leave the country for before that at any time
no i was always inside the country
dr ally earlier on asked somebody else the question about the
consumer boycotts and who was behind those boycotts was that organized
by the anc or the udf
it was organized by the community because the youth at
the time we were we were actually leaders to the community but we could
not actually tell the community what to do the community would decide on
their own and agree what to do and decide who will be their leaders and
when they decide to do something we would be the leaders to that decision
the policeman who were in involved in your arrest and
subsequent torture are they still in the community and are they still
yes some some of them are still around but most of them
are not here i don’t know where they are
can i can i ask you your opinion in case these people do
apply for amnesty and amnesty is granted what would you feel
that can be a good ting thing if they could apply for
amnesty and i would like it if they can come to me and explain why they
were torturing me i would like to know the main reason
porschia you are saying here this in incident of burning
mr polwani’s car was not actually related to politics
i can’t say it was not related or related what i know is
that maybe the way they took it at the time they had to relate it to
politics because i was a political activist at the time the politics
would be pol police were against politicians and we had work
underground all the time because we’re fighting for freedom so i think
for them to to relate this incident to politics they didn’t actually
have they didn’t have the reason to to to to arrest me they used the
were they actually looking for at the time and they didn’t
porschia are you saying some of you who were arrested were
were taken to court what did they do
they were being questioned about this incident of of a
these people who were taken to court were they not members
they were members of the anc youth league
what did they explain what was actually their reason for
burning pops’ car if they were members of political organization and pops
my question is that it they were really members of
political organizations why were they burning pops’ car who was not a
member of any political organization or even the burning of the car not
they way i understood it they burnt his car after this
rumour of him killing the teachers and other people that’s why they
they burnt his car another thing which i can explain to you is that for
the police to relate this incident with politics is that when the car was
bunt we were from the meeting at the community hall it was a youth
meeting and we were trying to vote for a committee we were trying to
start a committee at the time and we were not we could not reach
consensus and some of us i think tried to to go after that the
meeting to organize to burn the car but we did not discuss that at the
i see it was not a political decision
oh fine you political leaders at the time is it true that
you you could not you could not stop them
yes it was difficult to stop these people at the time
because they were going to cause problems
i would like to ask you how how for how long did they
do you mean in when i was arrested they did not
arrest me once it was many times i want to know are you relating to
i believe that you’re going to explain to us everything
which happened to you because of your political affiliation at the time
the way i was in those years i was very active in
politics even if it was just a group of men in a meeting or an
organization i would be the only woman or a lady that’s why the police
wanted me and they did not arrest me once they came to me many times i
think it’s about four times after the burning of pops’ house they came
and arrested me together with tshalo moraba they came and told me that
when the teachers was was was hit by a train they said we came and
threw stones to his house they took us to the police cells but we only
stayed there for two days they released us and in all these cases i was
i was freed i was given discharge i was not actually involved they
came they were actually arresting me for the things that i did not do
they came again in we were calling ourselves messina action
committee they arrested us for plus minus eight dates eight days they
separated us some of us took were taken to soekmekaar some in
pietersberg and some in louis trichardt i was alone in louis trichardt
it was a very frightening place it was dark i was at a cell in louis
trichardt it was a two roomed cell that was a bedroom and a toilet at
the same time the toilet was not working well they were giving me dirty
food and they were throwing it to me just as they did before in 
there was one guy who was my brotherinlaw he would actually make an
effort to go and buy me clean food and bring them to me and i was
supposed to hide it because he would be in trouble that’s when serf came
and katchalia they took us and we didn’t know where the police were
taking us to we passed through mara and we fetched some people and we
were taken to pietersberg to meet katchalia and ntai and they tried to
negotiate with the police to release us and they were not telling us the
main reason why they were arresting us 	when we arrived in pietersberg
they said we were the ones who arr organized a consumer boycott in
messina and we said how how can we organize a boycott it was the
community because we cannot stop what the community wants to do at the
time there were other ten youths who were arrested after the committee
was arrested those youths actually they started demanding our release
they wanted to free us and we actually started to demand their release
too after after we learnt in pietersberg that there there are other ten
youths who were arrested and we denied we didn’t want to be released
because we wanted them to be released too and they agreed that they’ll
release them and that’s when we agreed actually they were just torturing
us and threatening us every time they would they would arrest guys and
i would be the only lady even though i didn’t do anything
and we understand that this pops incidents was related to
politics because at the time they were against political organizations
but every time when you were active and boycotting and doing other
things was there a time where you did actually burn house of committee
no what we did we’re just marching and we went to to
their house and demand their resignations because they could not meet our
was pops seen as involved with community councillors or
sympathetic to community councillors that he became such a target
and and presently where is this person pops is he still in
the community or what what happened to him
can you just explain what do you mean the community evicted
after his house was burnt and after people were
complaining that he he must leave messina from that day he just
disappeared we could only see him during the his trials
and presently do you have any idea where he is or any
i heard that he’s in venda but i don’t know where in
venda i met him one day in venda but i don’t know where he’s staying at
miss nkundlane thank you very much for coming here and
talking and we’ve noticed this morning that this community of messina and
nancefield have thrown forward many strong woman and clearly through your
struggles in the in the ‘’s and ‘’s you’ve come out being very
strong that doesn’t take away the fact that you were tortured
intimidated during the many times that you were imprisoned i thank you

just repeat after me i swear that the story i’m about to tell is the
whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
jeanet you’re going to tell us about an incident that
happened in when there was a consumer boycott in messina could you
tell us briefly what happened to you on that day
on that day this is what happened it was in the evening
when we held a meeting in our hall suddenly we arranged to go to it was
told there are people who will go to town to buy whosoever could buy
cool could really face be faced with a lot of problems and then we’ll
have representations the following morning i woke up and bathed i put
on my uniform anc uniform and went to town arriving on town i sat
there as i was seated a train arrived from jo’burg there were people
going to zimbabwe some of them were offloading i mean alighting some
of them were going to the shops and i had to rush to those people to stop
them there was a factory which is now closed when i stopped those
people i was trying to explain to them that we are engaged in a consumer
boycott and people are not allowed to buy here in these shops because we
are fighting against the boers ‘cause we are fighting we have some
problems around and the zimbabwean women were explaining to me that
well we know well about the south african war and we are not involved
because south african people were not also involved in our zimbabwean
fight in i then explained that by then i was till a very young
person i was getting born we just want you to support us as our fellow
black people please don’t buy and those people went to the shops and
bought and then i explained to them furthermore and we went towards the
railway station arriving at the railway station whatever they had
bought they had a lot of plates and i just broke them when breaking
them i also took all the soaps suddenly zee moiana arrived when zee
moiana arrived he he said to me what are you doing and i told zee
moiana that as police you know very well that we are in a terrible
situation i explained it to these people that they shouldn’t buy or they
must buy in jo’burg and go to zimbabwe because we are still engaged in a
struggle here he held me on my clothes and then he he took me to the
station police station and we went there
	when we were at the office they took me around to another private
office whilst we were there there was another white man backs who was
watching over the window and he followed us he clapped me on my face
after having done that he ordered me to sit down and told me that i was
not really illiterate or educated in what i was doing i just kept quite
i couldn’t respond zee then started taking some books and pulled them
down and there was a docket he told me that there was a docket that was
going to be opened i admitted to the statement taking and then he said
to me the people who are encouraging you to do this are not going to be
in such trouble and very soon you are involved in these struggles and you
are not even educated and i asked him if at all the struggle really
necessarily need people who are educated or only the people who are
blacks fellow blacks then when those women were taken they were just
put outside i had to take statement there was nothing that i had to say
there i said i will have to say something in court and he said you are
very stubborn and those women were called to the office i was put in a
very private office like these where the people are interpreting there
were some burglar doors there they didn’t close the outside door after
that i was put there aside i asked to go to the toilet having done so
backs told me that there was no toilet and he said just do it there and
i sat there as i was seated there i could feel that i was really
pressurized i had to urinate and i just did it there after that it was
late afternoon towards three or four i told them about my hunger i
asked for food and the people who were buying food who had bought food
from the cafe they ate the food after having eaten they just gave me
part of the food i said i cannot eat this dirt i’m not a dog i
wouldn’t mind staying hungry for such a long time i will just go and eat
in the cell then i just pushed to the food away and then they asked me
to fetch the food again the statement was taken that was around past
six past five to six i went i was taken by a van four by four backs
took the i was handcuffed i i was cuffed on one of my legs and i went
to the police station they took me to the charge office and i was booked
in in a book and the cuffs were taken off i went to the cells i had to
ask for people to relay a message home that whosoever will see orbit or
abraham lerule or jackie makombi to tell them that i’m in the police
station there was a message that jeanet shall not be a worried because
we will be coming to release her the following day i couldn’t worry i
stayed there in a cell subsequently my own people from home brought
food i ate the food and slept
	the following day in the morning i went to court when i was in the
court i was told that my involvement in such case was very major and
there was a bail that had to be given up orbit went and fetched the
money for the bail i was released and there were taxis so there were a
lot of people inside i boarded the taxi and went to the hall on
arriving at the hall people explain as to what happened on my arrest
during the boycott times and now he’s back there but there was no
problem at all the others will have to be consulted and that court was
postponed the following day a lawyer ntai arrived who asked me several
questions and i explained to him and he was the one who was going to
represent it was postponed more than three times i was discharged
in your statement you said that you were still attending
school at that time and you were interrupted
you said you were an anc member and you put on your uniform
how old were you at that time
i was twenty six years of age
you seemed to have a consumer boycott was it made by the
anc and did everybody in the township respond to that
it was very involving and then we were all affected by
the way how the boers were really handling us everybody in messina was
what other protests did demonstrations did you have to put
your about you your your pride in in in the township
during that time the boers could take dirt from the
location to throw them in nancefield all the boers will take the dirt
and throw them in nancefield and there was a lot of dirt and you know a
lot of flies and we were fighting against that so that you know it
annikie just before you also talked about a march against
against vat and what other methods did you use there was a consumer
boycott and vat and what other marches were organized
well regarding the vat it was during the time when we
were gathered in town and some of the boers would arrive with dogs they
couldn’t give us any time to discuss or to arrange or to do whatever we
were there for and there was somebody who was of a senior he was said
to have been coming from pietersberg and there was no time the patrick
makado was trying to explain on a loud hailer and the dogs were just on
us and the rubber bullets were on us and we were running away whilst we
were running i ran i had to take cover in a shop in one white man’s
shop so called bopa and as he was about to close he chased me away and
i went out when i went out i went to the other side of of the
hospital as i arrived at our own hospital there was a van which
approached and some other three privates and another van this other van
had a lot of dogs and they started you know breaking all you know the
cars stopped and everybody was demonstrating the boers just grabbed me
on threw me under the van and i was thrown into the cell in the police
station i was put in a cell
were there also protest marches against the black local
well we it was about the vat issue
when you broke the things that the zimbabwean women bought
well i broke them because they bought them
did you break all the stuff that they had bought or you just
wanted to demonstrate that they shouldn’t have bought from the shops
well i did break a lot of plates and glasses and i was
about to destroy the soaps and that was the time when the police fetched
and so your you were represented by mr ntai in the case
it was ntai who represented me in this issue
was ntai the anc lawyer or your own lawyer
but according to your statement that case just did not go
any further and you were discharged
i say nothing came out as a result of the case you were not
what mr ntai told me was that he i didn’t have to go
back getting involved in all these activities because i was seen to be
sorry jeanet how long were you in detention
well about the vat it was about three days and then
regarding the destruction of the zimbabweans goods it was just overnight
and they released me the following day
when you were telling us how you confronted the rhodesian
or the zimbabwean people you said if they want to buy they had rather
go to johannesburg rather than buy in messina am i correct
and yet you were protesting against vat was there any
difference between the vat in johannesburg and the vat in messina
well i can’t talk about the johannesburg issued because
i realized they had bought goods from johannesburg maybe here in messina
they were just adding to what they had already bought in jo’burg
about other things that people seem to have been protesting
against is the dumping if i heard you well and then the vat did you
have any specific complaint against the black local authorities in
well regarding the councillors there were some
differences regard we even went to their homes to ask them to resign and
subsequent to that police were called and we were in jimmy chauke’s
house and the police arrived and they came on their casspir they just
started off shooting and as they were shooting we also retaliated we
threw some stones to them we were throwing stones and whilst we were
were you in any position of leadership in the organizations
yes i was in the anc leadership
was it the women’s league the youth or just main anc
did the women’s league ever have any specific complaints
that were related to the women or to their family life
for the three days that you were in detention what is it
that the police did to you
what happened was that one tall police guy arrived i
don’t know his name but i know he’s still alive when he looked at me he
said when i look at you my eyes really spill blood and i didn’t care
about him well i carried on i sang my slogan because it was not really
important i was involved in what were the problems around of course i
did understand that he wouldn’t have done anything at that time
nothing caused you particular fright or you lost nothing
with regards to what you ought to have been doing to the family at the
well what i lost was the job and i i was working in le
pomperei volaunch and then they chased me and said to me i must go and
seek job from mandela i’m just really getting troubles in getting a job
jeanet in your statement you say that you were you were
charged with with intimidation it’s true that the case was eventually
dropped but do you consider what you did to have been intimidation
could you repeat the question please
the charge against you was intimidation in that you forcefully
took away this woman’s goods you destroyed this these goods now
although the case was was eventually dropped i’m asking you whether you
consider whether or not your actions could be described as intimidation
do you see what you did as intimidation
i wouldn’t say i was really intimidating i think i was
determined in doing what i was doing not really intimidating people
so even if this woman didn’t support the boycott did you
believe that because she didn’t support the boycott you therefore could
actually take her goods and and destroy her goods
and was this done done was this was this common if people
didn’t support the boycott was this a common thing to do when there was a
yes because whosoever didn’t understand what we were
doing in our organizational behaviour we had to torture such people
because no maybe at one stage he or her could really support us in one
but can you also say that when you when your lawyer seth ntai
when he spoke to you about this he actually didn’t agree with what you
did that’s that’s the impression i got from what you said that he said
that what you did was not necessarily the correct thing to do can you
can you just clarify did i did i understand what you said when you were
well what seth ntai said was that i well as i was seen
to have been wrong i shouldn’t involve myself very well to be that
prominent in the organizational structures especially when people are
protesting well i must monentrarily decline i must just be a
backbencher or a supporter from behind and not that prominent well i
was not that frightened i carried on the way i was because that is how i
was determined i just in front i was very much in front
i understand what you’re saying that what you did was not
necessarily supported by seth ntai although it doesn’t take away what
happened to you in detention i want you to please understand that what
happened to you in detention is obviously a a separate matter and has
and it has to be dealt with but i was just trying to get to to the
background and understand the context in which these events took place
jeanet just two more questions earlier on in when you were
talking you said you talked about the boers now were these people you
referring to the police as the boers where you referring to a a certain
political party in in messina perhaps or was it the whole community that
by boers i’m referring to the white policemen
and my second question is just i think tom touched on it
earlier on this question of you being unemployable because of your
political records and activities does that still apply
even now i’m unable to work i even take my problem to
the women’s league because i’m unable to pay even water because of the
thing that i was doing in struggle i’m unable to find a job because of
all this and i was forced to join security and now i’m just doing nothing
but for peanuts for the security
so you are working at the moment
yes i’m working but i stopped working because i found
that the money was peanuts two hundred and ninety and i decided to stop
because that i’m i wasn’t satisfied by the money
thank you jeanet we don’t have any further questions what
you have described is a story that we’ve heard so many times as we’ve
travelled through the length and breadth of the country your arrest the
detention the treatment that you were given but i want to go back to
something the mayor said earlier when he was talking about how our how
our democracy has come about and i think part of that democracy is to
respect people’s human rights regardless of which political side they
may they may be coming from and i hope that your experience that you had
in those years is never repeated within the political history of our
country now so thank you very much for coming and you will be hearing
from us in due course thank you
is mr chauke here yet has he arrived no and mr thelele
has he arrived okay as these gentlemen have not arrived yet can i

russel will shall we call yours first then can i please ask sarah
sekhwama to come forward please can i also announce that i said earlier
on that we have a statement taker from the truth and reconciliation
commission in one of the halls at the back we also launched on monday of
the easter weekend what we call the des the designative statement
taking drive these are people who are living within the communities who
have been given training by the truth and reconciliation commission to
continue taking statements because often the impression is created that
people are only asked to make statements for a hearing remember the
mandate of the commission goes on until the fourteenth of december 
and therefore people have the right to make statements our proactive
statement taking drive will stop at the end of july but there’s no reason
why people cannot still send a statement in directly to the offices of
the truth and reconciliation commission but we have three people who have
been trained from this area mr alfred chisane maurice mbealane and
libowani matuse who are also present in the hall today and i will
announce at the end of the day where they will continue to be taking
statements in messina and the surrounding areas between between now and
the end of july so please there’s lot’s of opportunity to for people
who have not made statements to come forward and make their statement i
want to also say that we as you’ve heard today a number of people have
been mentioned who who were involved in the in the violations that took
place in terms of the of a ruling that was made at the appellate
division of courts of our country we have to inform these perpetrators
alleged perpetrators that their names are going to be used where the name
has been mentioned in a statement so every person’s name that you are
hearing today that person has been informed and has the right actually
to respond if he or she wishes if they were here today all right so
this is jeanet no this is sarah hey annikie annikie welcome can you
mr dr russel ally is going to be helping you as you tell
your statement but before he does that will you please stand to take the
i’ll as you annikie to raise your hand and say what you’ll
tell us will be the truth so please help me god
thank you you can sit down
annikie welcome and thank you for coming you’re actually
coming to speak on behalf of your sister sarah and you’re going to speak
about something that happened to sarah in where sarah was the victim
of a shooting and you’re also going to tell us what effect this had this
shooting on on sarah’s life so i’m going to ask you if you would just
please go through the the statement which you made to us if you would
if you would just go th through that for us thank you
it was in and we were marching sarah left us and she
joined the people who were marching and we were marching value added tax
next to the tavern a police van came next to us and there was a black
policeman with lots of white policemen i wanted to ask sarah where she
was going to and she said she was sent to go and fetch keith’s clothes
while i was talking to sarah i saw the black policeman who was looking
at us who was inside the car started shooting at us and he shot sarah
my older sister and she fell down i was shocked and people started
coming to us because we were crying and they tried to help sarah to rush
her to the hospital my cousin’s car came and fetched sarah to the
hospital and those policemen were very much against us and they didn’t
want us to take sarah they stopped tried to stop us to take sarah to
the hospital but after we explained to them that we were rushing her to
the hospital they released us when we got to the clinic they
transferred her to the hospital we stayed there for two days and we
decided to go to the police camp to give a statement i’ve forgotten the
name of the police whom we gave the statement because it’s a long time
	we waited for a long time and nothing was happening because every time
ther were lots of strikes and lots of cases were just disappearing when
i was asking the police what were they doing about my sister’s case they
referred me to the other guy who was left at the time who was
transferred he explained to me that the guy who was handling that case
had resigned i stayed for some time and i went back to ask what was
happening with the case because my sister had three kids and that that
other eye which was affected was affecting the other eye too so she
couldn’t get work and she could not support her kids also my family
could not support her because they we’ve we have many at home they did
not do anything to help me until today
annikie thank you for that sorry i should have asked the
person sitting next to you is that your sister who’s sitting next to
welcome to to her as well just a few questions annikie
first this incident was it in or because in your statement
the dates which are given or the date which was given is in august 
but when you spoke now you said in now this is important if we are
going to to follow up on on this matter so do you do you have a
i actually have forgotten the date because when she was
shot she had a kid at the time that was in 
does this event which took place which you you’re not sure
about the date but you th it was either or it was a protest
it’s the whole community we decided that we should take we
should march against vat to the camp
sorry repeat that where where were you marching to
we were going to the police camp
and this was a march to protest against against vat against
value added tax and you were marching to the police camp now can you
tell us a little bit about what was happening during the march
i have forgotten what we were actually marching for
i think that what you’re saying is that the march was against
vat but you can’t actually remember the details of what was happening on
when the police approached you people marching did they issue
any warnings or did they just start shooting can can you remember what
these policemen they actually were against any march in the
area because they thought we wanted to fight them when they see people
singing protest protesting or demonstrating they were attacking us
now in your statement you actually mentioned the person who
you who you say was responsible for for shooting your sister who shot
at your sister how do how do you know this
i know because the car that he was travelling in he was the
only black guy and i saw him when he started shooting us
so you actually saw him take the gun out and and shoot at at
yes i saw him with my eyes
did you know him beforehand or did you only find out his name
i knew him i only knew him that day that day of the march
when i wanted to ask my sister where she was from when i was busy
talking to my sister that black police guy took his guy his gun while i
was still talking to my sister the rest of the people who were marching
came to us and he started shooting and he that’s how he shot my sister
so his name who did you learn his name from did other people
tell you or did you find out afterwards
now in your statement there’s actually nothing about whether you
followed this case up did you do anything after your sister was shot
after she’d been taken to hospital did you report this did you go to
the police did you get any legal advice anything
we had a lawyer at the time that’s why i was saying that
when i went to the police station to ask what were they doing about the
case they told me that the lawyer who was involved with the case was
was gone he was no longer there
and this lawyer who was this lawyer can you remember
i can’t remember his name i think our mayor knows who was
so after you went to the police station and you asked and they
told you that the lawyer was at was not longer involved in this case
was that the end of it or did anything else happen after that
they made us to write another statement and they said they’ll
come back to us we waited until today nobody came to us to tell us
now this this shooting led to your sister being blinded in her
one eye does your sister receive any financial assistance as a result of
and and still now she receives nothing no grant or 
now this person who you’ll identify as the person who you
believe shot at your sister have you ever confronted this person have
you ever spoken to this person
i never talked to the guy i thought we would talk during
and your sister presently how does she cope how does she look
after herself her children what what is her situation
we tried to look for for a job and we are trying to assist
her family and her children and we just buy her clothes and my father is
actually supporting her and her family
thank you dr ally ms seroke
annikie i want to ask about your sister sarah did she start
to be mentally disturbed after the shooting or she was like that even
she started after she was shot
annikie how do you relate the march against vat with a
i don’t understand what you’re saying
when i understand you correctly vat that’s why i’m asking
you when you when you buy things how was it connected with politics
how was vat connected with politics
that is true actually when we were in a meeting they they
just told us that today we’re going to march against vat when we went
to me march for vat i didn’t know what we were going to do but they
when doctor ally was asking you who were the people who
organized the march you said it was the community
now i’m going to ask you a question when the community said
they talk about boycotting vat who was the leader of that community
there were so many people who were up front where the
who was the chairperson of of that meeting
when you mean during the time we were marching against vat
no i i say i mean during the time you were in the
meeting discussing about this issue of vat and we we had to march
which member was he was he a member of the a
ja he was a member of the anc
we we are talking about here
now we sarah at that time where was she coming from
no she was coming from one of my sister where where she
you mean she was not in the march
i saw here coming and then i i asked her where she was
coming from and she said she was having a a young baby and i was asking
her whether she left the the child behind she said i was coming from my
you mean she was not involved in the march
do you have documents from the doctor
no we took her to the hospital they didn’t give us any
you said the the lawyer is known by by the mayor
and the lawyer never told you how the this harass matter
is the lawyer still around in messina
no it was a lawyer from pietersberg
when did you last hear about the lawyer and this sarash’s
i asked the may the mayor in january on the third and he
told me i should wait a little bit he will start by phoning the lawyer
who who’s handling sarah’s matter when i went the following day he
said to me the lawyer is no longer in the anc’s matters and then i went
i went back to the the mayor again
you mean sahara’s matter is going to end just like this if
you don’t phone this this lawyer to ask for have pension because she
has she got children she has got children who are at still at school
let me go back to the march again when they they shot were they
shooting sarah while she was coming to you or were they shooting at
people who were in the march
he shot at sharah sarah while i was standing with her
you mean he was not shooting the people who were marching
no he was just shooting at random
after the march were you able to to know how many people
no we never asked anyone because we were very busy with
how old was sarah’s child that time today how old is
i think she’s seven years old if i’m not mistaken or six
mr manthata has already asked you about the relationship
between the protest against value added tax vat and what was happening
in the community the political conflicts can you tell us what else was
happening at that time in nancefield and messina were there other
marches taking place or was the march against the value added tax one
i think this was the first march
can i just try and remind you were there no marches against
you said sarah has got children you’ve mentioned one child
to mr manthata how many other children has she got and how old are they
sarah has three kids the other was born in the second
born in and the other last born was born in 
in your statement you also make the point that sarah became
mentally disturbed now this happened in how soon afterwards did
you did you begin to realize that there was something else wrong with
sarah besides the fact that she had been blinded in her left eye
no i think she was affected when after she was being shot
the mental disturbance that you talk about that sarah has
got did you notice it as soon as she came out of hospital
yes we realized soon after she was released at the hospital
because whenever she heard something like a gun shot she would start
and now you’re saying that she’s not receiving a disability
annikie and sarah thank you for coming today i have we
don’t have any further questions unless you want to add anything else do
you want to add anything else
thank you very much for coming today we will come back to
you once we’ve made more enquiries
can i please call mr thelele mr thelele good afternoon
welcome mr thelele can you please stand to take the oath
thank you mr thelele mr thelele you are taking us back to
 at the time sorry let me just at the time of the messina
advisory board mr manthata whom i’m sure you know sorry let me
finish hold on who you know earlier on talked about the advisory board
as well can you just take your time and tell us the important things
please of what happened to you in 
it was in and children from the location they came to
tell us that they’re being arrested in the township and when we go and
ask for work in the white areas the white man klopper refused to give us
permission to go out and work in the urban areas it was during and
 and exactly in lazarus knobe said thelele we have to elect you
to the board because the children in the township are being harassed and
also including the women about police coming around the township and
harassing people together with klopper and i said because i’m a good
man how am i gonna lead you and they said no just be a strong man and i
had to join the board and work on behalf of mr manthata in the board we
normally discussed community matters i told him people from the
	those people followed me and i didn’t take much cognisance of them and i
continued with my life one day when i got there they told people that i
was the one who was informing other people which we have been discussed
when we were together i continued being a member of the board and in it
was during august when they came to me and told me that they were
coming to fetch me and said i couldn’t care i was fighting for the
youth on on our location i told them i was worried because our kids
were not allowed to go to johannesburg and pretoria and old women were
forced to go out of their houses and i told them that white people were
staying in urban areas but then why are they controlling us in in the
rural areas i was the youngest guy in the cabinet at the time and they
could not listen to me they said i only knew jazz i couldn’t tell them
	one day i was with van der merwe and van niekerk and i explained our
problems at our township that people were being evicted from their houses
and they are given permits if they are supposed to come to the townships
they are supposed to ask for days and i asked mr manthata and i told him
that because i was young in the cabinet please help me what should i
do i think others were shangaan and they were speaking shangaan and i
could understand it and they told me that things did not work that way
and they told me and i told them that this is landsfield and people from
the camps are together with us and they should be we should all be
united i did not i was confused and the late mr shaw i also alerted
him that the police wanted him and patrick mpepo and celtic mathudi i
went to them and i told them that i was evicted from the location and the
people were not listening to me they’re saying i’m young and i knew
nothing they were at our location to open a new school for sotho
speaking people and they promised that they would meet those guys and i
told them that people who knew something were late at the time i’ve
stood aside and i told myself i’m going to watch them what were they
going to do about those problems police were sent to my house and they
told me i was not going to spend that night at my house and i told them
that i bought that house and i don’t owe anybody a cent and i told them i
was going to all those people are late now but those police were
cowards because they used to come during the night and they said to me
i’m i’m given only seventy two hours to evict evict my house and i said
no i was going not going to do that i was surprised when the police
came during the night and they shot all my dogs and they killed them
while i was still seated there
	this other guy who was a sergeant he gave me a letter and reminded me
that i only have seventy two hours and my youngest child was only three
days old and i asked them where should i go because i didn’t have money
at the time and i just hired john from standard bank who was promising
to take me and take me to another place for eighty rands and i didn’t
have money eventually they borrowed me money and i went to mara and
they told my boss lawrence that i was not supposed to stay at the
township and he even told their mayor that i was not a good man and he
told them that the other guys which i used to work with them and leon
claff that other people which i used to be friends with were not good
people and they used to say i was after people and i was troublesome
	i eventually packed with my three day old child and i went to mara and
the baby didn’t have nappies after that i put an appeal in pietersberg
and i contacted eight superintendents in the northern province and
klopper denied that he’s the one who caused all that trouble he said it
was members from his board who evicted me from my place and i tried to
ask what have i done and it was only because i was trying to help other
people who were not working one of those guys who was known as dabula
and the other one was blind and they most of the youth were unemployed
and they were sent back to their rural areas and they said that i have to
go back to pietersberg and from there i have to go to the magistrate
court when i was at the magistrate court they said i told them that i
have to go back to my home my furniture was broken i look at i look
for my home i couldn’t find anyone and it was hired out this is what
i’m coming to tell 	after that i went out and i went to a chemist and
children in the township said since you have come back try to improve
our life in the township and i told them what am i gonna how am i gonna
help look even at the older ones our grandmothers have been evicted
and even those who’ve bought four rooms houses they’ve lost their money
because they have to be evicted i asked whether this person who have
done all this it’s a good man because of the things you have done to us
thank you thank you mr thelele in your statement you said
that after mr klopper who was a superintendent in messina at the time
and was also a member of the board is that right
after he gave you seventy two hours notice you in fact
contacted a mr minnie the chief magistrate of messina to tell him of
what had happened and the chief magistrate said he could do nothing about
yes that’s what that’s what he told me he said he was not
involved in the issues from our township he said he was not he was not
so it was that common the way the legal magistrate almost
took no notice as to what happened to citizens in in the area
this white man was a snake he used to run and he used to be
a liar he was just a snake
thank you can i ask you to please settle settle down thank
you very much mr thelele you left with your family and you went to live
with your inlaws where did you go to where were they living
that’s true that’s what i did it was in mara
it’s next to louis trichardt it’s about plus minus fifteen
k’s i only know about my house it’s only forty eight miles
and you left your house and belongings here in nancefield
i didn’t have transport to carry those 
and when i get those transport i was i was no money and
anything those furnitures they used to broke indistinct it’s
only three days borne and they said i mustn’t be sleeping right in
location but i ask him what what a indistinct they said you are not
allowed to stay in messina be but i wa myself i’m a bonafide from
did he every give you a reason intervention
indistinct they said you must left messina
are your children all all right
thank you my last question is intervention
i’m asking the court why what had been done for that
my last question is when did you return to nancefield are
i came back to nancefield in that was in september
when i came in september i went to see klopper and he said am i back
from egypt and i said no i’m not back from egypt and i was a bonafide
of nancefield and he said to me i should be a lodger and i asked him
how could i be a lodger if i owned a four roomed house and i stopped
questioning him because i was afraid that he the man was going to evict
me again but i ask the truth commission what have been done 
sorry are you are you saying that you did not get your
house back somebody else is staying in your house
eh somebody is staying there but i don’t ja he’s staying
there but i doesn’t like it any more myself i doesn’t like to go back
there i doesn’t like because there are snake biters there near to me
sorry can i please ask the audience to to respect what’s
being said here and i understand that it may appear to be extremely funny
but it’s not the point of of telling the story
even to even today i’m prayed for lords there are too
many people in locations they’re still crying for their house for that
klopper who’ve been to taking those house and give it to somebody how
these come because they are bonafides from that house today they are
suffering because it maybe it was under bantu administration i’m
is mr kloppers still around in in messina
ja he’s still here in messina he’s still here and these
people they used to to ask where where is our house others others
they’ve been deposit others they are dead and never to to go forwards
to say where it’s our house where is our things because they’re still
under with that instruction of ou kloppers and there isis still the
chief in the under location even myself i’m here he can run up to
shoot me when i’m going outside
mr manthata earlier on said that when he was when a similar
 intervention sorry let me finish what he said earlier on was
that mr klopper also asked him to leave nancefield but accused him of
being a communist where you also being where you also accused of being
me i was i was cabinet with manthata with manthata and
when the time he chased me manthata he said you can rather do me
anythings because i’m a bonafide from location
thank you mr thelele i have no further questions mr
thanks i’m a pain mr manthata because we were only two the
others there was they hate us
thank you mr thelele thelele what you’re telling us is
what do no longer exist what you were trying to tell us today the pain
which you went through during those evictions and during the times where
you used to lived live by permits was something which today when we are
talking of human rights is we are talking about some of us when we
grew up those things were outdated and it could it could be a joke to
us like some of us are doing now my question is that while you were a
member of the advisory board at the time were you able to monitor how
many people were being evicted from their houses and when those people
were trying to to complain what help did you give them as the advisory
board if someone was complaining they used to come to us and we used to
solve try to solve their problems without going to the magistrate’s
court or to be sent to to prison especially the young ladies were being
very much protected and they used to come to us and complain about
impregnated by young men and we used to tell them that in messina as
people most guys were unemployed during those times we used to advise
them to sit down and discuss issues but the advisory board and that boer
they didn’t want to see young guys around messina i swear this patrick
mpepu and sal sedrick patrudi i talked to them and discussed these
things with them about what was happening around here can i ask you
again those people who evicted was it young guys who were single or
bachelors and young ladies old spinsters as you were trying to explain
to us that there were also older women who were evicted from houses i
actually want to understand who were being evicted from houses because
they didn’t choose they used to come at random during the
night and chase everyone you just hear that people were being taken away
during the night by the police
are you saying people were being evicted because they were
no what i’m saying is that the the the big vans who used
to come and make noise during the night and take people away everyone
and we used to cry and and be in trouble even older women were taken
away if they’re visiting coming to see their their grandchildren and
when we tried to help especially me they would not listen especially
maybe because they used to say i’m i’m i’m younger and mr manthata used
can you clarify this my main question is that were you
able to answer and solve the problems of your community because they
didn’t have permits and because of those evictions were you able to
yes we were able to solve them
that’s why my problem my question is how did you used to
we used to call their parents their fathers and mothers to
sit down with them and discuss those problems and not to run and go to
the white person and the police used to be against us and used to say to
us we were just wasting time and we were powerless as a result
i think i do not understand you clearly mr thelele because
when i’m saying when a person used to be evicted from a house you can
only satisfy that person by giving that person another house that’s why
i’m asking you at the time when you were a member of the advisory board
if a person was evicted from a house a woman being evicted because she’s
single an older woman be evicted because she’s a widower that’s what
my question is based upon that how did you solve these problems as an
as an advisory board we used to sit down call the parents
and everyone the community do discuss the issues so that we could
satisfy peoples and not take the matters to the courts
thank you i’d like to conclude by saying that the pain
which you went through as an advisory board caused and made the youth to
realise that the advisory board was useless to them and that’s how they
came to to decide to go to exile and train as soldiers what we are
saying to you is that your work of trying to bring together families and
the community to talk issued out was helpful but was not solving the main
issues wait a minute that’s why we are saying that you worked hard
during those times and it really hurts us to know that they evicted you
with your three year old child and we really feel pain to to hear all
that you tried to explain to us let me conclude by saying that thank
mr thelele thank you very much for patiently waiting i want
to echo what tom manthata has said and it’s clear that after so many
years that the pain that you experienced at that time is still with you
i hope by you coming here today and talking about experiences during the
’s it has helped in some way we thank you again for coming and we
wish you all the best thank you very much
	ladies and gentlemen that brings us to the end of these hearings but
before you leave i just want to make a few points you as i said right
at the beginning we received a number of statements and we chose those
statements that you have heard today but clearly the statements that
we’ve heard today do not reflect everything that has happened i’m sure
that if i was to walk and talk amongst you today there would be many of
you who would say why did you choose this statement and not that
statement first of all we can only go by what we have and at the same
time we are aware that that is not the complete picture this area for
example besides a pass a passing reference to the to the sadf and the
sap involvement we’ve heard very little of crossborder raids for
example we’ve heard something about how young people were passing
through messina but at the same time we have not heard enough of how the
community actually dealt with that situation hundreds of people must
have gone through messina and hundreds came back through messina but we
haven’t really heard from you as individuals and as members of the
community the role that you played in assisting people
	we heard earlier on and i said earlier on about land mines and and the
deaths that took place from those land mines but again nobody has come
forward to make a statement we heard one statement in pietersberg but
that’s all we’ve heard i’m told today by some of the people from the
media that there was a land mine explosion yesterday several people have
been very seriously injured now again i’m sure that you’re aware that
there’s been an international movement to ban land mines we from the
from the example of yesterday we certainly may have many more land mines
still in existence in still present in this area and perhaps we need to
make the authorities aware and i’m sure yesterday’s incident and the
injuries of those people will make them aware that the these mines still
exist but we need for people to come forward and talk about these i
said earlier on that we have informed all the people the alleged
perpetrators mentioned but clearly there were attacks on councillors in
this area there were attacks on police officers in this area we haven’t
heard any stories from them the deadline for amnesty application once
again is just around the corner as you know the original deadline was
the fourteenth of december we asked for a for an extension of that
period and the president agreed to it extended the period to the
fourteenth to the tenth of may of this year now the work of the truth
and reconciliation commission is based on trying to gather all this
information and it gives the opportunity to all of us who were who
either suffered human rights violations or were perpetrators to come
forward to tell their story and to contribute towards our new democracy
so i want to appeal once again to all of you who have been here listening
very patiently to go back into your communities speak to your friends
encourage them to make statements the designated statement takers i was
talking about earlier on will be taking statements at the parliamentary
constituency office i’m sure all of you know better than i do where that
is i understand it’s behind the chicken licken here in town and for all
for those who want to know the num the phone number there is 
	the last point i want to make is in the last week the reparations
committee and mr manthata is part of that committee had a conference in
johannesburg and some of you may have heard on the radio or read in the
newspaper that a draft reparation policy has been put forward they’re
working on the final touches to that policy i know that question has not
been raised from the people who have come forward to tell their stories
today but our feedback from our statement takers is that that is
something that many people ask wanting to know what is this reparation
policy going to be it is our our our plan to come back to report on
this on this hearing as well as other issues and i hope that when we
come back to to to the community we will spend a great deal of time
	i thank you again and i want to es especially thank all those people
who have come and told their stories today and thank you for giving us
the opportunity for being here with you today i want to also thank the
the council of messina for giving us this hall and and all the other
assistance that the council has given us as well as the north west
government so thank you very much and i wish you well on your journey
home 	sorry mr manthata tells me that this follow up meeting that i
was talking about will be on the third of may in pietersberg we will
through the structures that we’ve been working with in this area send
that message through your through to you again can i please ask the
priest from the catholic church to come forward is that mr flemming to
hearing closes with a hymn and a prayer
thank you father flemming sorry before you leave please
please please leave these boxes behind it’s of no use to anybody
we would now like to call dideka grace mishombo
you may remain seated mam but i would like to swear you in
chairperson the witness has been duly sworn
we would like to ask her to put on the headphones june
can you hear me mrs mishombo can you hear me
mrs mishombo you are here today to tell us about the death
of your husband ben mishombo on the th of august before i start
asking you any questions i need you to clarify something for me this
the death of your husband took place in johannesburg would you tell me
were you resident were you actually living there
we were residing in meletsani township in johannesburg in
johannesburg and on this day the th he left to go and look for his
mother and her grandchildren because soldiers government soldiers
would detain children gadjas soldiers were detaining people and late
that night an unknown man came knocked at the door and said that he was
sent by him that i should get three men to go and pick him up when he
got there he found my husband the name next door and his son and they
went and picked him up where he had fallen and they said that he had been
shot dead by gadja buthulezis gang when he got home he was reeking of
teargas it was unbearable and he was saying that he something was
burning him in his stomach he would want water and but he would not
	the following morning i took him to the surgery to dr mbega who was a
doctor at baragwaneth hospital dr mbega said that he was reeking of
teargas and it seems as if he had even taken eaten something and the
doctor examined him and we took him the following the saturday morning
the following day called an ambulance to fetch him and took him to
baragwaneth he was admitted to baragwaneth for three days and he was
brought back and i kept taking him and dr mbega would even do house
calls at some stage it became apparent that he was too ill he was not
even able to eat and we took him back to baragwaneth on the fourth of
september he died at baragwaneth hospital
mrs mishombo you say that he died then on the fourth now
samuel modikie who was he was
samuel modikie was his youngest brother they were together
on the day of this incident samuel was paralysed although he is still
alive today he is still in johannesburg where he is living with his
sister so ben died but before he died he said that i should come back
here and that i should leave the house in the care of his son i left the
house in the care of his son and when the son could not take care of
things he lost the house he lost the car and he came to stay with me
here in port alfred he is unemployed and he depends on me for
everything he has been with me for five years yet he is unemployed the
motor car and the house have been lost
he also had a business in johannesburg is that correct
yes i use to sew and sell clothing
now what do you make of this story that you were told about
the gadja buthulezi gang what do you believe and understand from that
i understood that it was definitely that group because
there were so many of them there in it was them the soldiers and
where was the funeral mrs mishombo where was the funeral
the funeral was held at oh dear i have forgotten the name
were there other dependents that your husband left as well
who else was there in the family at that time how many other children
it was only my son clive only there was not any other
mrs mishombo you came here with certain expectations what
were they that you wanted the commission particularly to do for you
i know that the commission cannot bring my husband back to
do anything for me but i would like the commission to help me to get a
place of my own to stay in because i am living with family and i am back
at my parental home and it is not i would like to live on my own
because i was living quite harmoniously with my husband but i have since
lost my house and lost my car i use to eat what i wanted and wear what i
is there anything more that you want to tell the commission
about this event anything that you feel you have left out that was
i do not know what else i can say
thank you mrs mishombo we have heard what you have said and
noted what you have said and the fact that you have lost so much
especially your husband and all the business and all of your possessions
but we are grateful that you are safely back in the port alfred
community thank you i am going to hand you back to the chairperson
mama mishombo in your testimony you mentioned something
about gadja buthulezis group or gang you mentioned something about
i spoke about gadja buthulezis soldiers who were driving
hippos in johannesburg at that time in they were patrolling the
area at that time it was said that they were the police and soldiers of
i am a bit confused because inkatha anc violence violence
between inkatha anc and udf started long after the period of are
you sure you are not confusing your facts
people spoke about gadjas soldiers because they were the
ones who carried knop kirries and drove hippos and they were said to have
been bought by the government of the time to assist them in soweto
was it said that gadja buthulezis soldiers were driving
yes they were driving around in the caspars and they would
detain the children and we were forced that at that stage to eat supper
at five o clock in the afternoon
who took away your house and your car
i would say that we lost it to the perm because we had
extended it we had built an additional two rooms and a garage and this
our son remained behind in that house but apparently he could not
maintain the payments and the perm repossessed the house
yes he is still alive he is living with his sister in
diepkloof my motherinlaw was staying at number moletsane
thank you very much for your story it is going to be
slightly difficult story for us to investigate because it happened in
gauteng and it is going to have to be investigated in gauteng but
fortunately we do have a commission office in gauteng which could assist
us by investigating because everything that gets put before us has to be
investigated but it should not be a major problem we will be very keen
to find out where samuel modikie stays because it seems as though he is
a crucial witness to your testimony for now we would like to thank you
and assure you that we will investigate this matter thank you very much
we will now ask the attorney mr mlalane together with
fezile ndongeni to come forward mr mlalane you are representing fezile
thank you do you want to address us are you going to lead
the witness are you going to read the statement into the record
i am just going to make a short resume of what happened and
then he is going to do the talking himself he can talk he is old
thank you go ahead mr mlalane
thanks first of all this matter is a matter of inquest at
alice and judgement has been reserved and the real problem is finding
witnesses and this happened at night apparently there were two groups of
the african national congress and the two groups were not in agreement
and there is no evidence yet that my client was the leader of the other
group but is suspicious that he was probably taking a leading part and
my client as he says was he friend of mr papu mr papu was actually
brought by him to that area there was no animosity but in the middle of
the night there was this fight my client 
can i just clarify something mr mlalane you say this
matter is already before the court
it is already before the court and judgement 
we are awaiting judgement and i am appearing in the case
do you want to insist on addressing us on this matter or are
you feeling that perhaps you are obliged to do so because we sent you a
i feel i am obliged to otherwise because this court does
not know anything of subjudaica otherwise i would have raised that this
is subjudaica because we are awaiting judgement in this case
yes i would like to consult with the committee quickly and
perhaps let us come back to you just sir you consulted us
indistinct mr mlalane that we accept and just put it on
record and when we are contemplating making a finding on mr ndongeni we
will then inform you and then you can make representation at that stage
the witness is in mr chairperson nombuyiselo ntsiba ngece
thank you mr chairperson they have been properly sworn in
advocate sandi will lead evidence on behalf of the
thank you mr chairperson will you please come closer to the
mike when you speak please come closer to the mike so that we can hear
you you are going to talk about an incident of in alice
could you tell us what happened what happened in february
on the th of october people knocked at my door
nokuzola opened they asked nokuzola where mthetho was they said the
last time they saw him nokuzola responded saying that the last time she
saw him he had gone to the march in bisho then the other brother emerged
and they thought that it was mthetho they asked who he was with
nokuzola said he was with the wife and child as my husband opened the
door they asked for mthetho my husband said he does not know where
mthetho was when he said he does not know where mthetho was there was a
bang on both windows there was smoke when i started screaming after a
lot of we heard a lot of bangs i saw blood on myself when i started
crying my husband said i must hide behind the door i do not know what
else he said but he fell on the ground the house was burnt
we will give mthetho a chance to talk as you maybe drink a
the speakers mike is not on
are you the one that the police were looking for that day
i was at work in fort hare
were you working at fort hare
who are these soldiers that came to your house
it was on wednesday th of october first of all a white
car in the afternoon drove past it was at about midday it was a car
that was probably wanting to find out what is happening at my house
mbulelo who is the last born at home when he saw the car he went and
told my mother my mother said mbulelo should go and find out what this
car is all about because it is because of these cars that my child no
longer stays at home mbulelo went but he could not write down the
registration number when i asked nokuzola if she remembered the faces of
these people mbulelo was going to write matric nokuzola thought that
mbulelo had been studying and had gone home late the reason why she
opened is the door is because they called all my names even my
nicknames it was clear that these people knew me well
apparently they went inside the house
yes after nokuzola had opened the door they went in they had
masks on they asked who is in the one room she said it is my brother
they then said she had told them that i was not there she then explained
that it was another brother they went to my room they found my brother
	there is a door that leads to the kitchen from the back our bedrooms
are aligned together nosipho had a one month old baby my
sisterinlaws child was two months old when she realised that there
was blood splattered all over her she was not sure whether it is her
husbands or her childs as she screamed and cried out she ran to my
father my father took her into his room the house was on fire by that
time when we said that it the whole family was out there they threw a
hand grenade onto the house they did not realise that my brother had
died they thought he was just laying there the people from the village
came my father was trying to stop the fire my father slipped and fell
i am sure that my fathers death is due to the injuries that he sustained
at that time the next morning a car was hired to take all the injured
nosipho was shot in the knee nokuzola who had opened the
door as she tried to jump out of the window she injured herself at the
back she has got a big scar they also shot her at the shoulder my
niece was shot in her hand then my sisterinlaw was shot in the arm and
the stomach also elby was taken to the hospital my youngest brother
came to tell me that our house had been burnt down when i asked what had
happened he just said we must go we got into the car when we got to the
anc offices everybody from msobomvu was there my father was there as
well i was then told that my brother had passed away if i had the
strength at that time and i knew who the perpetrators were i would have
gone and revenged because my family is as it is because of them these
	we then left for the hospital when we got there we saw my
sisterinlaw i knew by then that my brother had died i did not want to
see my sisterinlaw because she was going to ask where my brother is
she asked as i thought i told her that he was in another room in another
hospital room she heard two days later that he had passed away i
reported the case at the police they hardly took notice of me really
when i got home there were police taking photographs
mthetho why were these soldiers looking for you
mr chairperson i think that it is because i was the secretary
of sanco also the chairperson of the youth league before all that
whenever there was a political incident in msobomvu the police would
arrest me the police whilst i was detained would try to look for
evidence to link me to whatever incident then they would not find any
evidence and they would then take me back home therefore i do not know
that particular time why they were looking for me
before this while incident was there political unrest in your
the police would come when we have meetings coming to disrupt
the meetings i do not remember anything else
were peoples houses burnt down or was yours the first house
would the soldiers have any contribution in disrupting
the soldiers at that time would go to msobomvu they would camp
in one particular field with their trucks
how did the soldiers relate to the people how was their
relationship between the soldiers and the members of the community
there was disharmony the thing is the soldiers if they would
come across you at night or in the evening they would attack you
are there soldiers or police that you know of that contributed
to this damage in your village
yes since to the case has been investigated mr
galane private investigators were investigating the whole case there is
someone in the community dansda my sister came to me saying that dansda
had bought me expensive boots and jersey i asked why i asked my sister
if my sisterinlaw if she owed him anything and why he had bought these
things for her my sisterinlaw tried to find out why it is that dansda
had bought me these things the police went to mr dansda mr dansda said
that he knew exactly who it was that was involved because he was part of
the planning he did not list these people but in mr galanes
investigation there is a soldier mr tsanda who is in king who said
that he had come across madoda kula and madoda kula said that they had a
mission to accomplish in msobomvu and i was the first person that they
were going to beat up therefore mr kula was one of the soldiers that
mr tsanda said this is mr tsanda a police
he is a soldier he said that he could not go the answer came
the following day and there was a report that they had completed their
job and then he started being harassed
where is he do you know him
is he here in the hall
yes he is here there he is
is that all the evidence you have
can we go back to mrs ngece mam were you able to identify
i was sleeping i just heard a voice
after a while did you find out who it was that had done this
mr galane came to us saying that he was investigating a
dimbasa case and light came to our case as well three people madoda
kula sandile mati and welcome maronono
did he question these people or interrogate them
there was a case and the with the three of them but the case
the case was withdrawn because apparently nokuzola who had
opened the door said that she could not identify the people but she
where was she identifying these people
she was called to a parade
is there something else that you would like to talk about
nombuyiselo is there something else mam
no if he continued with the story then it is alright
what is this story about somebody buying you a jersey who is
was he the one who bought you the boots and the jersey
i thought that he had bought me the jersey because we have the
is he a policeman or a soldier
did tsanda mention dansdas name at all
so it is not related at all
do you have requests before the commission
first of all i request that the commission investigates this
matter fully we would like the perpetrators to divulge everything and
let the justice take its course if i say i forgive these people i would
just be saying it i cannot forgive these people my child asked day and
night where her father is i cannot forgive them they are with their
children sometimes kayda points at men at other men strangers saying
is that all the evidence we have
i am going to agree with my sisterinlaw i have no
forgiveness for these people i hope that one day whenever that is they
come before the commission when people look at me in the streets they
conclude that i am a criminal we had my brother killed there is no
peace in my heart these people in the community look at me and they
laugh these people if the commission finds these people i request that
these people be jailed all their lives i never want to see them again
thank you mr chairperson i am handing over to you
are there any questions sorry mr ngece did this incident
occur the same day as the buddy incident in the village
yes it was the same day
were there two groups attacking the two homes or was it the
is it mr galana or galena
until it was taken to court
yes no the case would be postponed now and again they would
promise that the case would be taken to the regional court but that
never happened until it was withdrawn
therefore mr galane will sort of give us a lead
there is a mr dansda who claims that he knows all the people
who were involved how was he involved was he one of these people
i do not know sir because mr dansda was not working at the
time but before that he was working in transkei with lizo lomzie he
stayed in msobomvu he said that i must go to him because he has got all
these people that you have mentioned in your statement
maybe nombuyiselo can answer this question because it is her statement
madoda kula welcome maronono sandile mati these three people you did
not see them on that day
thank you there is madoda kula here with his advocate they
want to dispute some of the things that are in the statement
thank you mr chairperson ms ngete you are going to talk about
your uncle mafu matiwane who was years of age in when he was
killed could you tell us what happened to him
on the th of september in my uncle left our house to go
back home he met two soldiers they asked where he had come from he
said he had come from johannesburg then they said that he had burnt down
makhapelas house he said he did not know anything about this they took
him beat him up and took him to mr makhapelas house at mr makhapelas
house he cried out saying that he had done nothing he does not know why
he is being beaten up a little while after he had beaten up he walked
out the soldiers followed him shooting him until he went through a
passage as he was going through a passage going home his jacket got
caught in a fence and he fell
	as he was lying there the police kicked him saying that he was
pretending that he was dead malule his brother came through he was
watching after that they realised that he had died they left him there
and they went to makhapelas house at home where i stay my sisterinlaw
came telling me that my uncle had been beaten by soldiers who are staying
at mr makhapelas house i went going home when i got home i thought
that i would find him and take him to hospital but when i got there he
was i tested his pulse and touched his eyes he was not blinking i
realised that he was dead i wept and i thought to myself i have no
mother i have no father he was a father to me what is going to happen
	after that we went to chief mbandlas house to report this matter chief
mbandla said he had no phone we got a lift to the police station when
we got there we presented the case the police said to us we had burnt
down makhapelas house but we go back to report the case to them
makhapela said the man who is killed is not guilty the one police said
we must wait the police vans were deployed they would come back later
at eight o clock a bakkie came a police van they took us back home and
they also took us to the corpse where my uncle lay it was half past
eight at the time mr jonas took over so that we could bury him properly
do you have reasons that you know of about the death of your
were there organisations that were in dispute in your community
my uncle was an anc member he was killed by soldiers
so these soldiers were from chief makhapelas place why were
this is where his house was burnt down the house had been
are there people who had been arrested in connection with this
therefore there was no court case
i went to the police station and investigated reported the
matter gave in a statement after that there was a promise that there
would be a court case in there was a summons that we should go to
court as we were in the court yard we realised that they were not
calling us in i went to the investigators sergeant said i had already
left for seymour mr ndita was handling the case we wanted to find out
what was happening mr ndita told us that lindile mashiqa has been
absconded in pretoria he absconded therefore he was not there i
wondered why they were not notifying us about this case
are luvuyo and lindile people that you knew
lindile mashiqa is in qoboqobo he works there he has got a
house in dimbaza luvuyo matyila he is at malamkoma
therefore the court case could not continue
did you have representatives legal representatives
no except an attorney smith and in king williams town to
whom we gave the case to
do you have a request before the commission
my request to the commission is there should be a follow up we
need compensation and especially because we the funeral costs were on
our soldiers the government did not contribute in any way

the incident which you are going to talk about took place on
i will now hand over to you to tell us what happened on this
on this day we were at home the group my husbands group came
at home to look at what was happening they saw that things were quiet
my husband told them to leave because that day there were no people
around at midnight my husband said that we must sleep and these people
must leave only three of them have to stay he then told us to go to
sleep it was myself and another woman who was staying in the makuzeni
village but now she is in zizinie we slept together with that woman
	while we were sleeping we heard something on the door this woman by the
name of nofirst ran out and i followed her a petrol bomb in our street
was thrown i saw my husband running we also ran nofirst and myself
there were two cars isuzu and mazda we went through these cars we saw
that there were people who were chasing him it was mr fezile ndongeni
gumeli tselane and one young man from fana family but i do not remember
yes he was chased by four people after that it was dark we
saw that there was one of them with a torch he was following us
nofirst ran away he ran to tell people that papu was being killed
after that as i was sleeping with children i took children to the
neighbour my grandchildren one of them was three years old the other
was years and the other one was eight years old i took them to my
neighbours house i was crying my neighbour told me not to cry because
these people would come in that house i then stopped crying i peeped
through the window because i wanted to see what was happening but i
could not see because my house was on the other side on the other
	while i was still looking through the window i saw a light coming from
gomorro it was a car i saw this car that it was going towards my house
it stopped at my house i told this my neighbour to look after the
children because i was going to see what was happening i saw my husband
lying down with a wound in the head and in the stomach there was water
he was attacked because he was an anc member he was an anc
activist there was a group who was against the anc they wanted to be
this group where did it come from
it was the group from the village that because they wanted to
overthrow the executive of the anc at that time

yes five people were arrested gumeli was also arrested but
he was acquitted when he arrived at the police station he told the
it was gumeli fana he told the police everything that was
happening he told that mr fezile paid them together with landezwa to go

the people you mentioned in your statement vuyile mbane

heard that they have been arrested i heard that gumeli was arrested but
when we went to court i told them that he was in qesi but at the time of
the court case he was not there i was told that he was released so
is that all you wanted to say mrs papu concerning this
before that one woman came together with the police there were
houses which were burnt down this woman said that my husband was the one
who burnt down these houses i asked them how my husband could do that
because his house was stoned on the day before the good friday but the
petrol bomb did not work did not explode

please come nearer to the mike please tell us shortly
the first incident when it happened i was in hospital in
gida i broke my leg i fell from a motor cycle when i was discharged
from the hospital it was on friday when i was discharged from gida
hospital i then arrived in king williams town when i was about to take
a taxi home in the taxi rank i heard people saying that where are you
going because your house was burnt down i did not understand this i
went to the taxi the taxi man told me that they are not going to the
bhele township because peoples houses are being burnt down and your
house sangotsha was also burnt down the taxi driver told me i said to
this man you see that i am injured you can just take me to the village
he then agreed he took me nearer to the location he did not go in the
	when i was about to reach my home one of my neighbours approached me at
that time it was about to rain one of my neighbours took me to his house
telling me that my house had been burnt down i asked when he said on
wednesday that same week i asked who burnt my house he then said that
he saw ntsothos boy by the name of 
yes msikeleli together with zilindile ndzuzo koleli
pokothi and others they took a paraffin from mr zokozas house to burn
sir the people who you just mentioned who are they
they are people from our village
why did they burn down your house
i still want a reason why they burnt my house i do not
were you a member of any political organisation
yes i am an anc member
did you have any position in the anc
yes i am the chairperson of the anc
do you think that the burning down of your house has got any
connection with you being a member of the anc
i can say so because the people who burnt down my house
they were always calling the police when we have meetings the police
would come and tell us not to have meetings in the township
were these people members of any organisation
yes because at that time the headman were abolished in the
township they then joined adm but after gqozo they joined pac
the damage at home because my house was a fiveroomed
house it was fully furnished it had bedroom suites dining room suites
and lounge suites there was also another room which had a bedroom suite
where my children were sleeping everything was destroyed
where was your family at the time of this incident
my family was not there because everybody was at work
mxolisi heard about this when he was in east london at
work when he heard that his home was burnt down he went there it was on
saturday to examine the extent of the damages on sunday he was going to
visit a friend at night he came to me at night on the sunday as he
arrived on saturday examining the damage to the house on sunday he was
coming back from his friend it was at about at night if i am not
mistaken he then said that ord zokoza and wede simon were pointing guns
at him trying to shoot him he managed to escape because his friend had
a girlfriend in the house this girlfriend cried they then went out to
the next door house this house was a shebeen his friend then went out
to the shebeen to look at them they were drinking he came back to the
house he told him to run away because these people were drinking next
door he managed to go back home we then spent the night in my
	in the morning it was on a monday he said that he was going back to
work he said that he will buy clothes and blankets for me in east
london he went he left trying to catch an eight o clock bus i was to
take a taxi to bisho for a checkup that same monday when i was in the
taxi rank i heard that there was a noise on the other side i asked what
was happening the people said that there were people fighting i took a
taxi when i arrived in town one young man said that it was mxolisi he
was being attacked by young men from bhele location i asked whether he
was still alive or not they said that he was dead he was covered by a
blanket i went to bisho because when i heard this i was in town
	when i came back i heard that mxolisi was taken by the police to the
mortuary i asked what happened i was told that when he was going to the
bus stop he was attacked by msikeleli ntsotho together with luzitie and
zuzo and koleli pokothi and mankeya mzimkuli gilenzoto they shot him
are these people the same people who burnt down your house
yes he ran to sifakies house fikiswa then took him
outside they arrived and they shot him they dragged him to the street
msikeleli then saw that he was still alive he came back and he shot him
after he was killed were these people arrested
no there was no court case
did you report this incident to the police
yes we reported this to the police
no nothing happened i would go to the police station and
ask them what was happening they would tell me that i must come back
but nothing was happening we then went to the detectives in zwelitsha
they said that they will investigate but up until today there was no
did you go to any attorneys for help
you received a settlement amount from the government
but you said that the money was not enough because you did not
what is your request then to the commission
the request i have to the commission is that i would like
to be helped because i lost my property secondly mxolisi has got a
wife and children i would like the commission to educate mxolisis
how old are they do you know
i am not sure but their mother is here she can tell you
we would like you to bring their mother to the investigators so
that we can get that information is that all you wanted to say
thank you sir i will request that i handle all the witnesses
and then i will hand over to the chairperson your house was destroyed
your cars and this all happened because you were a member of the anc and
sanco th october is that so
please come closer to the mike and tell us briefly as to what
it was in when the anc was unbanned as the residents of
ndakana we organised that the african national congress rise up there
was a resident association sanco we as the sanco members tried to
mobilise the anc branches around the area we succeeded in raising these
structures of the anc in our area we were confident that we were
progressive we were fighting for liberation we our desire was that we
have a contribution to the struggle for liberation in this country
	in there was a march from town to bisho we managed to escape the
shootings at bisho when i got home i realised that it was not well
nothing happened that day however i think the wednesday passed on
peacefully on the thursday two am i was not staying at home at the
time because of the oppressive ways of the xhosa regime they would come
at any time intimidating us looking for anc members i left home i could
not sleep at home i was seldom home i would have to lock the door so
that people thought that i was not there even if i was sleeping inside
the police would come at the time we did not have meetings anymore as
leaders if we held a meeting the police would come and disrupt they
wanted leaders especially of the meetings if i had come out i would be
harassed i could see that the police had a lot of anger and bitterness
because we were members of the anc and we were active
excuse me mr maguga could you just move a bit backwards thank
and that kind of life mr chairperson one unfortunate day the
police came and found me at home they took me into a ford sierra on the
way it was clear to me as they spoke that my life was at risk if i had to
continue with the activities of the african national congress and sanco
got to zwelitsha to the headquarters of the security branch got there at
about seven in the morning a short while after i had arrived the police
came i think some were from mtanzane they started swearing at me the
one started to wanted to slap me they were asking what i was doing in
the village why is it that ndakana i was causing chaos for the
brigadier what do i care about the anc i said that my heart was with
the oppressed black man of south africa i was not thinking about myself
but to see our people being oppressed by the government of the day also
i said to them the gqozo regime was part of the master plan of the south
	there were a lot of questions mr chairperson some i could not answer
but eventually i was released i was given conditions that as they
released me at five o clock in the late afternoon i was told that i must
not no longer be active as an anc member in the village i went home i
could not keep quiet i could not just sit and do nothing i had to
continue with my struggle with the anc on the tenth after the bisho
march and massacre as i was coming from stutterheim i had been driving
in a bakkie that a friend of mine had lent to me i drove back in that
bakkie at about six am from stutterheim the youth three youths came
towards me they warned me that i must not be shocked my entire house
had been burnt down but there were two rooms still standing they said
that my kombi had been burnt the other the windows had been broken
down lastly the house of your friend was there was also attempt to
	i went home and it was as they said everything inside the house was
burnt my cars were burnt as i tried to investigate the matter in the
village i asked the residents if they did not see who it is that burnt
down my house i asked if they could not stop the fire they said that
they were too scared to come and put the fire out as they were scared to
did you find out who is that burnt down your house
no i did not find out even though i went to report this
matter to the police what shocked me about the police is that they asked
me they asked which organisation i belonged to they said before they
take a statement it was imperative that they know which organisation i
belonged to i told them that they knew they said that i am a member of
the anc we were just asking to confirm
they tried to take a statement because they wrote down all
did they do anything about the matter
they did not do anything about it they just said they are
going to see the house of an anc member that was burnt down
were you able to stay in your house after that
no i was unable to do so because there were curses from the
are you talking about the headman what did this have to do
what did the headman have anything to do with this incident
when our meetings were disrupted the police would say that
they had been called by this family the sandile family the headman
because apparently we had called meetings that had nothing to do with
the government of the day the soldiers were patrolling at that time
were based at the headmans home there was a house that had a double
storey the soldiers stayed upstairs there were a lot of soldiers that
stayed there i cannot i could not even count them we thought that that
could be their base there is another reason why i could not stay at
home before my house was burnt down i slept under my truck because i
was hiding away from the police about eight men came to my home the one
passed next to me they had tracksuits on that i thought were tracksuits
that belonged to the ciskeian police they tried to kick down my house
the door into my house i think that they got information that i would
sleep at home at times even though there would be a padlock outside the
	the ciskeian soldiers the ciskeian police the police force the
socalled police force these people were the reasons why i could not
stay at home because they would come searching for me they would shoot
at people at night in the village nobody was happy nobody could live
mr maguga you said that these soldiers stayed at the headmans
house sandile did they stay there or would they be there now and again
would they be based there now and again
it is the police that would go there now and again after my
house had been burnt down they actually stayed there the soldiers were
staying there even the socalled peace force they would be coming from
after your house was attacked and burnt down you then went into exile
before i did that i must tell you about what hurts me the
most before i went into exile my friend nonkilesile bovane she asked if
we could meet in stutterheim she assured me and said that i could leave
with her car well i said to her that i would go to port elizabeth to
talk with my family and tell them what was happening she then gave me
permission to use her car to go to port elizabeth i then said that it
was not wise for me to use this car because people already knew it
especially the government she then begged me to use it i said yes but
i knew i was not going to use it i got to port elizabeth i was there
just for the weekend on the monday i heard that there is a lady that had
been shot in ndakana i did not know who it was i thought that i should
quickly go back fortunately there is a youth that i had taken to bpc
churches because the sandile people would beat this these youths up
they would beat them up and put them in bath tubs
	sandile was sent by brigadier gqozo i met this youth in town they
advised me not to go back home because mpondo sandile has been cursing
who is it that was shot
are you talking about the lady the bovane lady
yes these are some of the things that really hurt me because
this was the person who was going to help me through life this is one of
my major grief there were rumours that before she was shot she had been
is this the time you went into exile
yes mr chairperson i could not go back i could not even go
so you went back home in when the villagers went and
yes they said that as i had a contribution in the struggle
for liberation now that the country was liberated i could go back home
was there a court case in frankfurt
no until today i still do not know who burnt my house down
what requests do you have to the commission mr maguga
even though the father of the deceased came to the truth
commission i would like to know who it is that shot her and why she was
shot i personally would like to know as well why it is that my house
was burnt down who is it that burnt down my taxis i also request the
truth commission and the government to give me some form of compensation
even if it is one taxi because after all this i realised that my health
had deteriorated i cannot work even if you look at me mr chairperson
you will realise that i cannot be employed
what do you want to see happening to the perpetrators
i thank i am grateful that the truth commission is operating
it is this commission that will heal our wounds especially the people
that have been hurt the truth commission mr chairperson i request that
the perpetrators come forward people must not be scared to come forward
and tell the truth people must not be deceptive just because people
were not arrested at the time of the incident does not mean that they
cannot come forward to the truth commission and divulge the truth i
would like the sandile family to come forward as well because they kept
the perpetrators in their home i think peoples hearts are not totally
healed in our village this could lead to violence because people are
bottling up wounds that have been unattended i want to know who killed
my friend and why i want to know why my house was burnt down and why
thank you mr maguga mr zokoza please mr maki zokoza your
story is also concerning the adm as you were also a member of anc sanco
i would like you briefly to tell us about what happened to you
especially on the first of june 
thank you mr chairperson firstly i would like to greet you
as we are here today to the commission i would like to start in 
and tell you about the story the bhele story in cikizini on the day
when brigadier gqozo said that he did not want the chiefs and the
headmen as the people from the bhele we said that we wanted people to be
elected as chairpersons we then elected these people we elected mr
tamsane selman i was the treasurer at the time of sanco which was the
	one particular day it was felt that in the chairperson has to be
changed mr selman a new executive committee was elected i was then
elected as the chairperson i think it was on the th of june if i am
not mistaken while we were in a meeting as the committee trying to
discuss what we are going to do as the newly elected people the police
came from tamacha they asked us why are we there we then told them that
we are the executive committee of the residents association one police
said to me mr zokoza this organisation was banned he said that the
organisation i am leading was banned i asked him where he said in bisho
in july he did not give me an exact date i said that i did not know
what you are talking about it is the first time i heard about this
was this happening after the organisations were unbanned
this police said that they were again banned
yes i said to him this we did not hear as the residents of
the bhele it was the first time we heard about this that the residents
association was banned this police said that on a monday we were to
appear in tamacha police station briefly it was five of us we went to
the police station two woman and three men when we arrived there there
were men from bhele who were already there the station commander who
was mr solilo said that we are trying to rule bhele township he said
that there was a headman in that township we have to obey his rules he
said that we were no longer allowed to have meetings we told him that
this surprises us because you are telling us about a headman in the
police station you are a police and we were not aware that the headman
was elected by the police but as we are the community the residents
from the bhele we are not aware of this this man said that we were no
longer allowed to have meetings in bhele
	we said that we were not going to argue with you but we have a question
to you that as i am a member of sanco i am also a member of anc
because according to my knowledge the anc formed sanco we then
requested we then asked whether we can have anc meetings but we are not
going to follow the headman this man said that you can have anc meetings
in bhele we thanked him for allowing us to have anc meetings but we
were not aware that sanco was banned but we will ask to our leaders
mr zokoza when were you taken to the headman by the ciskei
thank you mam it was in if i am not mistaken on this
day it was in the evening i was sleeping i heard a stone in the door
i told i said to my wife there was something in my door i went out i
saw boys but i could not see them clearly they ran away in the morning
we found out that there are three or four houses whose windows were
stoned we were confused at that time we sent a person to the police
station to requesting to request help so that the police can send
patrols in the area for evenings we gave ndetayou money to go to tamacha
to the police station the police did not respond but they took the
	mr chairperson at night when i was sleeping i think it was about ten
or someone was knocking on the door he said that i am ndetayou
please open the door he said that i was together with the people from
the government my wife went to the door she opened the door one
soldier came with a gun he told me to wake up and put on my clothes i
asked where are you taking me he said put on your clothes after that i
put on an overall i knew that they were going to kill me i did not want
to have a hat on i just took a scarf and this soldier told me to stop i
told him that it was cold outside when i went out there was one soldier
outside with a gun there was one bakkie but i do not know the name of
the bakkie there were people there in that bakkie mbulelo holana was
inside this bakkie then turned upwards it stopped in teleles house
the one who was appointed to be a headman there were many people in that
who were these people in the house
what happened to you when you got to the headmans place
when we arrived at the headmans place there was a man who
said that you are tagged and killed our cattle and mr zokoza you also
took money which i was supposed to be given by the residents
i will come to that issue mr chairperson i said that this
surprises me because it is at night and i said that i am going to repeat
this because i could see that there was something happening there this
report which they wanted me to do at night was that as the residents
association there is a school in our township it was damaged but we
said we as the residents association said that this was dangerous to
the people because the people were injured due to this we then decided
to pay r and to try and to repair the damages in your school
we do have your story in front of us but i would like you to
emphasise on the burning down of your house and your illtreatment
thank you mam briefly the soldiers said that we are going to
be taken there was a message that these people are to be taken and
killed in transkei we were then taken by this bakkie by the soldiers
they were beating us all the time they were illtreating us they would
use a nut which was tied to rope
we were seven it was myself ndetayou mbulelo holana david
these people who were assaulting you did you know who they were
i am not going to lie mr chairperson i do not know who the
people were i do not even have a picture of them today
they were assaulting us they beat us until the morning they
we were asked what we were doing at bhele we said that we are
just members of the african national congress
even there do you know any people
no we did not recognise any people our eyes were full of
blood at that time we were all swollen up
did you go to a doctor to get a letter or a paper saying that
yes i went to we went to a doctor at grey hospital
do you still have these papers

question it was on the second of april as a leader as a chairperson of
sanco the residents asked me to go to zwelitsha together with certain
people so that they can get pension from the government it was on a
friday i took two people with me when i arrived in zwelitsha we were
rejected because it was said that as a chairperson i have no right to
take people to get a pension a headman had the right to take these
people so that they can get a pension they said that i was taking
headman’s place i then apologised but i said that according to my
view the bhele people elected me to go there to ask pension for these
people but i said that i will go back to the people and report this
	we came back from zwelitsha when we were in town at the taxi rank in
the bus rank one young man from bhele township mr vumani i have
forgotten his name he said to me your house had been burnt down i did
not believe this i could have died due to shock that day as a man i was
strong i knew god planned this because he gave me strength not to fall
down to be strong we myself and selmane decided to go and meet this
sanco in the subregion we told them that our houses were burnt down
the subregion then phoned the red cross they said that these people
will come and take us there

to go and see what happened we could not wait for the red cross to come

that he will only give me money to build the house i went to the
subregion of anc to tell them about this matter they then took the
matter in their into their hands i do not know how they did it but i

i would like the present government to help me with my
mr simon ndindi funda could you tell us briefly sir about
thank you mr chairperson it was the th of october th
of october it was at about midnight i was at home i heard my
dogs barking and i realised that they must be seeing something i got up
went out they ran towards the road when my dogs saw me they came
towards me i went back inside the house but two or three minutes later
after i had got into my bed there was a bang on my window and then an
explosion the explosion caused me to fall on the floor
the next morning we saw a bomb next to the house that had
unsuccessfully exploded soldiers came in the morning the soldiers came
and picked up these grenades our houses were our windows were damaged
and also my furniture was damaged we tried to buy more furniture and to
where did you stay at that time what was the name of the
were there other incidents in this village similar to yours
a house was burnt down we never found out who was involved
were you a member of any organisation at the time
i was the chairperson of sanco and vicechairperson of the anc
were there other political organisations in the village that you
there was the adm even though we never saw their members as
such we tried to organise meetings it was just a few people that were
was there ever outright conflict between you and the members of
one soldier called me he accosted me saying that he is
brigadier gqozo’s bodyguard brigadier gqozo apparently said that i was
working together with mrs mantoyi whose exhusband was a headman this
gentleman said that brigadier gqozo was happy that i was working with
this lady i tried to question because i did not understand but he got
angry and i just left him the whole village came to my house after there
had been the explosion he came alighted from a car and went around the
house to my next door neighbours we were looking at him he then went
to walked to another house he sent a boy saying that he is able to stop
the bomb that had not exploded but the people verbally harassed the boy
do you know who threw the bombs at your place
no to this day i do not know except that the soldiers came in
the morning i suspect that they know about this
exactly when did they go to your house
they came on the day the next day after my house had exploded
the next morning the one had a video camera his name was qishane i do
not know who called them because we had not reported this qishane was
did you get any compensation from the government
did you report this to the police
yes it is the police that came and put out the bomb
did they take a statement and investigate the matter
a statement was taken geyena was handling my case
they said that the case had been withdrawn because there was
not enough evidence i gave evidence about the soldier that i had
reported they said that they had called the soldier and he denied
what is the name of the soldier
did he stay there in zwelitsha is he still there
yes he is still a soldier
what requests do you have before the commission
i request that the commission calls soni so that i can ask
myself what happened secondly if the commission could build my house
thank you i will hand you over to the chairperson the other
members of the panel may ask you more questions
thank you mr chairman i am going to ask mr maguga a question
if he could come closer to the mike mr maguga you mentioned two names
whilst you were talking mpondo sandile and chief sandile is it the same
first of all mr chairman there is makobo macoleza who is the
chief of magagale he had a house in the village the second person is
his younger brother who stays with ms nolizwe he was a soldier under the
you were saying that there was conflict between the residents
of the village and the sandile household were you talking specifically
about mpondo sandile or about both mpondo and chief sandile
the problems and chaos that led to us being before the truth
commission today is mpondo who was taken by brigadier gqozo to be to our
village it is mpondo sandile that i am about here today
therefore chief sandile is not involved in this incident as
chief sandile had no say in the battles of the village i just
want to clarify that at the time we started having rallies and marches at
the victoria ground he would be called as the chief of the magagabes he
would not come because he did not
want to go against the government of the day therefore he had no
contribution to his brothers oppressive ways however mr chairperson we
had no problems with chief sandile as such it is his brother that we had
thank you mr maguga thank you mr chairperson
mr maguga you mentioned a peace force when you gave your
evidence what contribution did the peace force have to the community
when we tried to investigate what the peace force was about
and its origins we discovered that the peace force was comprised of youth
members of our community that had been called where jobs had been
advertised youngsters that stayed in farms in the area went and joined
they were told that they would employed they would be trained they
would protect people shops and shopkeepers they would be more or less
like watchmen but this concept of the peace force got twisted along the
way it was used to protect people who worked for gqozo especially
members of the adm however mr chairperson people were deployed to
ndakana to work there as members of this peace force and people from
ndakana were taken to other areas
we got evidence from one of the hearings in the commission
that aligned the peace force with chief sandile according to your
knowledge is the peace force aligned with chief sandile
yes i did mention that the base of the peace force was at
sandile’s place i think that mr chairperson that as we did not see who
controlled the peace force we realised later that it is mpondo sandile
who actually was the leader of the peace force
therefore the base of the peace force was at mpondo
sandile’s place therefore it was not chief at the chief’s place
no it was under nolizwe’s son who was taken by brigadier

the charge office a white city golf stopped in front of the police
station three men entered the charge office and they knocked i said
they must come in one of them had a balaclava on and pointed me with the

eyes he told me to close my eyes again after telling me that they were
going to burn down my home
what happened what did these people do to you after all this
they took what was in the safe
they took six rifles from the safe they also took my gun
no i do not know them
what about yawa did he know the girl who phoned him
i think so because he answered by saying that he does not have
time to go and answer the phone
did you make a statement to report about this
yes i made a statement to the police i made a statement in
did you make a statement at that time
what i did at that time is that i untied myself in my legs and

where the guns were they said that these people were my friends they
were beating me and they said that they were not afraid or scared of the

beating me up when i woke up i could see that i was bleeding through my
ears and my mouth i was also injured in my legs and my hands because
they made me to do pushups

letter to him saying that i mentioned his name in he then said that my
thank you mr chairperson you mr sinam you were dismissed from

about on the th of september i was called to appear in front of this

as you were a police was this a form of torture that was
i would just hear people crying but at that time i can say
that this kind of torture was the one used
thank you mr sinam we will try to contact mr dorrington so
that we can hear his side of the story so that we can also find out who
is the investigating officer of your case this is a painful story we
did not know that the police were also tortured in this way maybe you

this time when we are investigating your case for now thank you mr
mr chairperson i would like to swear in mkhululi mvuzo
thank you mr chairperson he has been properly sworn in
thank you mr chairperson good afternoon mr sizani can you
can we ask that the cell phone be switched off please it is
constantly interrupting us i think i have heard it more than twice now
mr sizani you are understanding that you can answer in
xhosa and i will have an interpretation now the incident that you have
come to tell us about today happened on the same day as the bisho
mr chairperson i made a mistake in the date because it was
on the th i stated that it was on the seventh that is a mistake it
was on the th of september 
alright then mr sizani would you then like to tell us what
you were accused and by whom you were accused
mr chairperson i was accused by our headman mr malangeni
makapela he accused me of burning down his home on that day i was at
home i heard that the house was being burnt down i saw flames in that
house my uncle said that i must stay at home because people were
gathering together to go and look at what was happening i stayed at home
	the next morning the police came i am sorry the soldier lindile
mashiqa and luvuyo matyila when they arrived i was in my grandfathers
house i was eating bread because i did not eat the whole day while i
was still eating luvuyo matyila came in together with makayise he asked
whether i was mkhululi sizani he was having he was holding a r i
said yes i am mkhululi sizani he said that i must finish what i was
eating after a while lindile mashiqa also arrived i think he was
outside at the time when he got inside he said to me let us go he did
not ask anything because they were drunk they took me i asked them
where are we going they said that we are going to mr malangenis house
they were assaulting me all the time with the back of their rs they
	we then arrived at mr malangenis house i was shown a letter they were
beating me they said that thembinkosi jakaza they asked me to go and
point thembinkosi jakazas house we went there but thembinkosi was not
there his father was there my grandmother told my uncle that these
soldiers were going to kill me my uncle would go and talk to them so
that they can stop what they were doing he went to these men he told
them that this young man was not in this incident he was then also
assaulted because these men did not want to listen to him i told them
that i have a witness the person with whom i was with during this
can you just i just want to stop you for one moment can
you tell me the name of that witness was that thembinkosi
yes it is thembinkosi when we were about to approach a
corner lindile came shot me in my left knee i did not hear that i have
been shot but while i was still walking i saw that i was shot and i fell
down when i was trying to stand up they were beating me and assaulting
me with their rifles after a while two young boys at about years of
age they passed us and they were called they were these men told them
to take me we were then on our way to this eyewitness but
unfortunately he was not there we arrived at the house of simphizwe
mabambolo the door was locked they were beating me at this time i
could not do anything they were assaulting me after a while then they
instructed these boys to take me to mr malanagenis house
	while we were on our way approaching this house they put me down and
they told these boys to leave i was told to go with i was told to
crawl lindile and luvuyo would insult me all the time they said that i
was going to tell them who actually burnt this house when we arrived
there i asked for water because i was thirsty lindile mashiqa gave me a
five litre i was forced to finish the water like a monkey i would drink
the water partially as some of it would be spilt out they then would
take my teeth and hit them against a rough stone my teeth are damaged
it was at about three when the police came i was then taken to the
	as i was being taken to the hospital the police van went via a village
i was in great pain when i got to the hospital but before we got there
i was taken to the charge office and i was identified at the hospital
they then referred to referred me to makiwane hospital i spent four
months there i just need a glass of water
while you are drinking that i just want to ask you a
question when you were being taken by the two year old boys what
were they why were they asked to help with that process of taking you to
there was no transport as such so they took a wheelbarrow and
i see so they were just helping alright so when they had
finished assaulting you they took you to the hospital
i was taken to the hospital victoria hospital
and you were there for four months now during that time
did you make a statement then or did you make a statement after that to
the police about what had happened
i gave them my statement after i was released from hospital
january i was referred to makiwane hospital that is where i spent
the four months the investigators came to my house they said that i
must go to dan hans to get to give a statement it is where the
investigators have their offices the investigator said to me that they
are still investigating the matter until lindile and luvuyo were found i
up till this time you have heard nothing is that right
now at the time that this all happened you were you still
yes i was still at school at the time of the incident
i was in standard nine at the time
is there anything particular that you want the commission to
yes i am not well i was never well after this my request to
the commission is that the people who are perpetrators must come forward
to the commission i need compensation i was not born like this people
who see me now cry they cannot believe it is i who is like this there
are a lot of things even when i am thinking i get very nervous this
does not make me happy at all it depresses me i need these perpetrators
to come before the truth commission they have to divulge all i need to
know why they shot me i was not one of the people who 
did you say earlier on that you do not know where these
people are because in your statement it says that they stay in the same
neighbourhood was that at the time of the incident
yes they were in the neighbourhood they were in a village
next to us the distance is between bisho and king williams town
but they are no longer there
there is one that is still there mashiqa i see him now and
again but apparently he is a soldier in dimbaza
and how is your relationship with him and how is the
when we see each other as i have been to that village before
i cannot even greet him cannot say anything to him because i am like
this because of them i cannot bear talking to them my life is not as it
should be as a result of their illtreatment
my last question to you mr sizani is did you ever approach
thank you i am going to hand you back to the chairperson
mr sizani there are no further questions your case is
clear we have heard your requests before the commission we are quite
interested as well that if these people have applied for amnesty we
will link the cases i do not know if they will allow because you say
you request that you be given some compensation from their own salaries
people do not want this they just want forgiveness we sympathise with
you we will look carefully at your requests thank you you may step
is mr sikongozi dumile sofaka here matongisi willie
you look like you are sulking please smile
thank you mr chairperson they have been properly sworn in
we welcome you gentlemen from berlin you look angry as if
you are about to fight may the digeni people travel safely we will hand
over to tiny maya who is going to lead evidence on behalf of the
thank you mr chairperson mr dumile i will start with you you
are going to give us evidence about your son who was killed in mdantsane
in his name zulani how old was he at the time
he was at the time born 
was he a policeman because according to your statement
apparently he had gone to fetch other policemen that he was working with
he was fetched by police on the th of september they
were being taken to postdam police on the saturday i went to find out
what was happening when i got there the police said i must wait outside
after about ten minutes a sergeant from nu came they said that there
is a man a mnoche man who got an accident with two other police they
were shot they took zulani to fetch yet another policeman this is when
they got this accident being shot by people that are not known even to
this day apparently there is still no clarity about this case
therefore if nobody came forward maybe the police gave a bit of
clarity do you not know anything up to this day
no i do not know anything
he was arrested because of his own things not because of
no on the saturday i just gave in a statement at nu we
then went to the mortuary and they took us to nu after that to show us
the place where the accident was
did you have any legal representatives
yes i went to king street in east london i was asked to give
a deposit for r i paid after a while i was given documentation
they said that i was not worthy of pressing charges on the government
therefore no claim was made no compensation
what is your request before the commission
i need the commission to help me i need compensation if my
son was alive he will be supporting me
yes i need help there as well they keep on saying that they
do you have more evidence to the commission
mr matongisi mr matongisi your incident occurred in on the
st of september you were a member of the udf in berlin you were
then attacked by the police in a gathering could you tell us briefly
mr chairperson on that particular day we had a meeting a
general meeting for both parents and the youth as it was clear that we
are members of the udf and also we worked at town and were members of
sawo there was water that was taken to the townships we were the gula
village was then not given the water we wanted to know why we had not
been given water they then said that our water should be drilled from
the ground we had no water we investigated the matter as there was
absolute disharmony next to lita there was a dam that was constructed
we then found out that our village had a right to get water from that dam
	after we ascertained that we are also supposed to get this water we then
called a general meeting for all the members of the community we gave
this time the youth became violent the children were angry the
ciskeian police were driving around our community and the youth wanted to
attack the cars we then went to the meeting sebe at the time there
was something happening in his home i do not know whether his daughter
was getting married or his son had just come out of circumcision school
we went to the inobuthu primary school for our meeting our children were
singing liberation songs in the village we got to the school hall we
realised that the whole thing was out of our hands there is nothing we
could do there is a stage just like this at the school the children
then went onto the stage of the hall i also went onto the stage
	we started the meeting we sang the national anthem as we were drafting
the agenda we looked there were windows right around the hall and we
realised that there were police right round the police went in they
started beating us up with batons also steel batons i was beaten right
here on the eye some of the batons would go right around the head when
they hit you we were like young boys asking for forgiveness saying oh
father forgive us it was painful we were humbling ourselves there was
nothing else we could do after a while there was silence we got out
there were rifles as big as that camera right over there all around we
realised that if that those rifles were used there would be trouble
	they told us to sit down we sat down like little children what i did
first of all is i went there where the children were held i asked why
the children were held this is before the meeting i went there and
asked why the children were held they denied it i tried to hide after
that i was wearing green i was wearing green overalls from murray and
roberts where i worked i just lay there as they beat me the children
were taken to nu the charge office there there were so many cars
there i could not even count them the elders were told that they must
never do this again they must just go home now we were bleeding we
were injured i was the last one there being beaten by the same police
	the children were taken we then went home it was difficult i thought
i would not be able to sleep i must go to a doctor we went there to the
hospital it was full there were nurses there were soldiers nobody
cared we were just given tablets they would not even examine us they
told us to come the next day we took the tablets and we left we went
home and i thought no this is really painful now i persevered the
sunday on the monday i was told that there was a doctor at anniden this
doctor took us we told him what happened and he could see how injured we
were we were told that we did not have to pay this doctor but i paid
r and he took it even though they said we did not have to pay i
gave it to him freely because i thought it is only r after all he
said that i must come and consult
	this doctor asked me if i have legal representatives i said yes mrs
she is in highway mtanzani we went to this attorney she
was not there we asked the interpreter where she was apparently she had
we asked she is arrested because of this whole matter that
concerns all of you so i thought oh lord who is going to represent us
now when is she going to be released because we need representation
they do not know they said they said we must wait we waited and waited
i went back to this doctor doctor what do i do now he then gave me a
letter and said i must go back to the attorney i went and they said that
i must come on the third month i went there and the interpreter said you
cannot get her the ciskeian law says that no attorney should stand
against the government therefore you have no legal representatives you
can do what you need to do
according to your statement sir you said that one of the
reasons why you were beaten up is because you were collecting the snip
cards and were burning them is that so
yes it is so at work we joined sawo as a man you had to
pay r and a woman also had to pay r for weapons and you had to
pay r for nbadagandoda and also r more for a card you had to pay
all this money we got nothing they just said that they are upgrading
the standards but nothing happened my health deteriorated even under
the second government i am not well then i said that i am not going to
pay all this money we then said that each person must burn their own
cards if you had a green card just burn it
what requests do you have before the commission
well sir as a person who realises that the battle is not
yet over i need compensation i need a third leg my two legs are not
good enough because of the ciskeian police i need support i must get
something because i have been fighting in the struggle and the people i
was fighting with are now dead i am still alive i am on this platform
therefore i should get support and compensation
are you saying you say that according to your statement you
lost seven teeth when you were beaten up
and you also said that the commission must buy you false teeth
that is so i was kicked by a young boy kicked my seven
teeth away therefore the commission must get me false teeth yes i
milile your incident is similar to mr bangeli but your case
happened on the th of september you were only years old at the
can you please tell us briefly what happened to you
in under the sebe regime mr sebe was an authoritative
leader in our village nkqonkqweni on the same date on the th of
september the youth took the sinnip membership cards from the people we
were still young boys at the time we were still playing boys this
happened while we were playing together with others we saw people coming
towards us we were playing together with my friends they took our
tyres because we were playing with them we followed them we did not
know where they were going but we just followed them we also climbed in
	the police came with their ford sierras a powder blue and white ford
sierra they were coming towards us people were saying were telling us
not to run we were in the back of this group i just saw people
dispersing and i heard gunshots all over i also ran away while we were
being chased by the police there was one police who approached me he
shot in the air telling me to stop i did not stop because i told him
that you are going to beat me he then assaulted me with the rifle butt
i fell down after that he beat me with sjambok and then the police left
me there one other police came he asked me who are you i could not
talk because i was swollen up
the police beat me in the head
i was not helped because after the police assaulted me i
stayed at home i was looking after my health
did you go to a doctor or hospital
yes i did go to a hospital
yes i was treated for my eyes in cecilia makiwane and i use
to go there for treatment because they saw that my eyes were weak i
have to attend treatment now and then i decided to go to the doctor
because i could not see clearly with the spectacles that i got in cecilia
did you manage to go back to school as you were at school at the
yes i managed to go back to school i am doing standard ten
what happened to you after this incident you said that in your
statement you cannot see clearly you have partial eyesight and you
suffer from constant convulsions is that correct
this is due to your injuries you sustained in your head
did you notice any police who did this to you
these police they all passed away
no there was no court case
what is your request then to the commission
my request to the commission is that as i am in this
situation i pay for my treatment my eye treatment i have spectacles
today because of what happened to me i would like the government to help
me in this matter in order for me to pay for the treatment because
according to myself i see myself as paralysed i cannot work for myself
do you receive any treatment now
do you receive treatment in hospitals
would you like us to help you with medical treatment
yes i would like you to do that for me
thank you milile i will now hand over to the chairperson thank
did you say that you were shot where were you shot did
they shoot you or did they beat you
they beat me with a rifle and i fell down
we thank you gentlemen from berlin we also thank you
milile we could see that you were injured due to this incident we noted
your request or your requests but i would like to thank the gentlemen
who told us this story although this is a very painful thing the way
they told the story was very interesting we thank you because you are
the last ones for today thank you we will now come back tomorrow at

our proceedings here in grahamstown will be conducted in xhosa we

their pain that they experienced in the past they were fighting for
everybody in this country south africa we thank you for coming here we
will now start with our proceedings for the day

perpetrators and those who benefitted in the apartheid system they are
not like the victims they are not opening their hearts to the victims

took me outside the assaulted me saying that they are going to shoot me
and they are going to kill me
	toto mankayi said that he wanted to kill ten people they were
assaulting me all this time i managed to escape and i ran away to
another street end street and i went to one house no in end street
at that time i saw that i was severely beaten up and i hid under a bed
while i was still under a bed tobile nobebe came in he pulled me out
because he asked from one little child where i was and the child told
him that i was under a bed he pulled me out he took out a gun and he
shot me while i was lying down he dragged me into the street and he left
	when he was going to shoot me for the second time children from that

when you were giving your statement you had a request to the
commission to forward this request to the president together with his
team do you remember what your request was do you receive a pension
do you have a request to the commission as you have just
explained your painful story to us
what is your request to the commission mr tom if you have one
the money i received was not enough i paid out lawyers and i
is that all you want to say mr tom do you want to add
thank you mr tom maybe you will be asked questions thank you
thank you mr sandi june crichton
good morning mr tom can you hear me
i just have a couple of questions for you the police that
broke into your house on that day were they amachaka were they
and did i hear you correctly when you said that mankayi said
that he wanted to kill ten people that day
were you involved in a political organisation yourself you
were about years old i think were you involved in greco
no i was at home at the time
so you were not a student
and as far as the payment to you was concerned was that
payment made with your agreement was the amount discussed with you
no it was not discussed with me
sir i would like to ask you whether there are people who are
dependant do you have any dependants
i am staying with my family i dont have any children
mr tom according to your view what made these people what
drove them to come to you and to shoot you and left you injured what was
were there any political conflicts in the area at that time
were you in a political organisation
no i was not a member of any political organisation
when the case was in court what reason did they give for
i did not go to court my lawyer went there to represent me
mr tembinkosi tom we thank you for appearing in front of the
commission i think that it is not only your testimony that affects us
but the way you are your situation it affects us because now you are in
a wheelchair you cannot do anything for yourself you cannot support
your family because of the two men who came to your house
	we thank you for coming in front of the commission because maybe these
people want to deny what you have because said they might say that all
the testimonies are lies but i think if they can come here and see you
they will know that these things happened and they injured people they
	we heard your request and we will try to forward your request to the
president of this country we promise that we will look into your
request but i want people to know that by appearing in front of the
commission they must not feel ashamed for their involvement in the
struggle for liberation we are not a court of law because i know people
used to deny everything in a court of law they would deny being involved
in the struggle even if they were found with books of our liberation
they would deny everything because it was a disgrace at that time you
told us that you were not involved in politics and i want to tell you
that it was not a a to be involved in politics what we are looking at in
this commission is the cases of people who were injured due to political
conflicts i dont want you to change your testimony but i want to
clarify that people are used to denying their involvement in political v
our main aim in this commission is to find the truth the whole truth we
are not looking at the trial cases
	thank you mr tom you may step down
where is jacob nombiba who are you maam
she is my daughter she was present at the time when her mother
we welcome you and we would ask rev xundu to help you take
an oath i will start with you mr joni tsili please stand up

about the situation in grahamstown so that we can have a clear picture of
what was happening in grahamstown please nomangesi tell us briefly give
us a clear picture of what was happening in grahamstown
at the time there were school boycotts there are schools in
our streets andrew moyake and natalenyawusa high school on this
particular day all the people came from josa to join the boycott
students would not wear their uniforms it was about nine or ten on that
day we were going to the shop i was going to the shop together with my
mother we watched students as they were toyitoying singing around the
school we were passing a crowd my mother was disturbed by this because
her son was a comrade and he was a member of this crowd
yes i was doing standard one at the time i was years old
your mother was she a member of a political organisation
in other words she was coming from the shop
we were on our way to the shop at that time
what is important is at that time people were struggling they
did not want to accept that policy of the government at that time
your mother was just passing by
yes we were just going to the shop
according to your view was it an incident that your mother got
when we came back from the shop we saw police vans we
decided to go home the police came out of their vans together with
dogs some of them went inside the school beating the students there
were residents outside who were watching this students couldnt go out
because the gates were locked we ran away because everybody was being
you said that police were beating black people
yes they were beating people all over in the street
there was no law governing at that time
we went in the first yard but the owner of that house chased
us away we went to another yard but the gate was locked we couldnt
open it my mother tried to let me in that yard but she couldnt go in
there was a small hole it was the last time i saw her i came in that
house there were many students some were injured
according to your view your mother got shot at that time
at about five minutes when i was inside that house i heard
from those who came in that house saying that my mother was shot outside
in your statement you mentioned that the police who shot your
mother was tungata did you see him or did you hear this
i heard this from people my father used to go to court
because i was still young i couldnt understand what was going on
the name of tungata was mentioned in court
did he agree did he agree that he was the one who shot your
after the court case were you compensated by the government
no we were not compensated but they told me that my lawyer was
defeated by the states attorney i was supposed to pay i asked them
what for they told me that my lawyer was defeated by the state attorney
i told them im not going to pay the money they said that i must not say
that i am not going to pay the money but i must say i dont have it i
told them that im not going to pay the money if you want to shoot me
shoot me so that i can join my wife	they told me i have to pay the 
the police in the police station told me the police station in
do you know the name of the policeman who told you this
no i dont know his name i told them im not going to pay the
yes but the police were all over they were in my house they
wanted to shoot the people who attended the funeral i went to the police
telling them they must leave my house
you mean that this funeral was not dignified
yes they told me to bury my wife on a wednesday i told them
that im not going to do that because my family was all over some of
them were in port elizabeth but we managed to bury my wife on saturday
no she was not working she was selling veg in the township
but she was supporting the family by selling veg
what would you like the commission to do for you
i dont know what to say but the commission will see what to do
for me because my child was only years old at that time others at
least were grown up but i tried to educate them
listen sir you will have to tell us what you would like the
commission to do just tell us your request so that we can see what we
can do so that we can forward your request to the president
my wife was supporting me we were not suffering at that time
now i am alone and i cannot support my family
thank you thank you mr chairperson
before my colleagues ask questions let me continue with mr
nombiba what is your clan name sir
mr zizi can you please give us a picture of what happened when
it was in when this incident happened it was a funeral
that day mrs tsilis funeral it was on saturday in people went to
the funeral and these boys after the funeral went home and thereafter
late afternoon that day the hippo were all over the township i sent my
boy to the shop at that time to go and buy paraffin after a while he did
not come back i heard seven shots being fired i was not happy i was
restless because my boy was not coming back i went out looking for him
while i was still doing that i saw one boy coming in asking where boyboy
was staying i said he was staying here he told me that he was shot on
the corner of q street we went there together with my wife we found him
lying down he was not dead at that time we tried to find a vehicle to
take him to the hospital we managed to get a car
was boyboy a student at the time
was he in a political organisation
i am not sure because at that time the children did not tell
us everything they would deny being a member although they were members
was mrs tsili a member of a political organisation
i dont know but all the boys went to attend her funeral
you said that it was a political funeral in grahamstown do
you agree that mrs tsili was buried and her funeral was organised by the
i dont know but the boys went to attend the funeral i dont
know whether they were activists or what when i was asking my son he
were there any regulations made to the funeral or were there
i dont know because my boy didnt tell me anything
were there police at the funeral to observe what was
happening they used to observe activists funerals you mentioned that
these boys went to attend mrs tsilis funeral after that there was a
toyitoyi what i am asking is that was mrs tsili a member of a political
organisation or were the police observing the funeral
i dont know about that sir
you said that you sent your son to the shop and you heard that
he was shot was it the usual thing that when you send your child to the
in other words you are saying that the police were just
your son was also a victim of this police act
yes there was a court case after a while after his funeral
yes the policeman was in the court he was testifying against
did he accept that he shot him
yes he said that the reason for him to shoot my son was that
he was leading a dangerous in q street they were throwing stones this
policeman said that it was then that he decided to shoot him to protect
the white men in the hippo
was that the end of the case
do you have a request to the commission to forward to the
can you please repeat your question sir
sir maybe you have a request to the state president due to
this incident because you lost your son do you have anything to say to
the commission so that we can forward your request to the president
yes i do have a request this child was supporting me at
home i told the statementtakers my request because they wanted me to
say what i want from the government and i told them i told the
i told them that i wanted the government to assist me to
do you have any request except the one youve just mentioned
do you have anything else to add
mr chairperson i think we are finished let me hand over to
thank you mr chairperson i would like to address this question
to the tsili family mr tsili you said that during the court case did
nobody represented us they were just talking to us they
showed us the police who killed my wife they said that he was tungata
from port elizabeth he was a tall man
you say that you were not represented by a lawyer
there was a lawyer but i dont remember clearly who it was
because i was still confused at that time because of the loss i dont
know who hired the lawyer because i did not hire a lawyer but there was a
lawyer representing us the one who it was said he was defeated by the
i want to make sure about this mr tungata do you have his full
no i dont know his full names but they just showed us him
you said that in court mr tungata accepted the responsibility
to say that he was the one who shot your wife
yes he said that he was shooting students who were running
away the bullet shot my wife
he said that he was shooting them because they did not want to
attend classes he wanted them to go back to school
you mean that they were standing them they were shooting them
telling them to go back to school
yes they were shooting them and there were dogs all over
let us go back to r the police who said that you were
supposed to pay r is there a written order that they showed you from
court stating that you have to pay r
no there was no written order we were in the police station
we were not in court at the time
did you receive a letter at home saying that you must pay r
no because i told them that i am not going to pay the money
they asked me whether i was i had a car or a house i told them that
whether i have a car or not is not their business because i am not going
this mr tungata did you hear anything about him
no i last saw him in court in my wifes case
thank you mr tsili thank you chairperson
mr nombiba i have a few questions for you i want to know
sir who was representing you in court who was the lawyer representing
there was no lawyer representing us
why did you not hire a lawyer were you not interested or
were you not able to afford a lawyer
the reason is that at that time the police said that i was a
killer i was the cause of all the trouble in grahamstown that is the
reason that i did not hire a lawyer because all the lawyers were under
thank you sir for that answer we know that many people lost
their people they couldnt get lawyers because they thought that the
lawyers were representing the system you mentioned that there was a
policeman who said that he was the one who shot your son do you still
i heard his name being mentioned his name was philip i also
saw the name on my sons death certificate the name of the people who
is it possible for you to give us the death certificate so
we gave the death certificate to the statementtakers
when this policeman gave evidence he said that he shot your
son because he was leading a dangerous mob
yes he said that they were carrying stones
was he defending himself or what was happening
he said that the reason for shooting him is that he was
defending the white people in the hippos it is when he decided to shoot
you say that he was defending white people who were in the
yes their soldiers and their police
they had weapons guns with them
they were being protected from children who had stones
at that time he was years old
but as i am reading in the newspapers they say that he was 
years old i think they just assumed i know that he was years old
yes he was my son i was surprised that they just assumed
thank you mr chairperson mr tsili and mr nombiba i can see
that you are old people and i believe that old people are wise under all
the circumstances you have just explained to us the incidents that
happened to you as these two families do you have anything to give us
or do you have any advice to give to the government to make sure that
such incidents are not going to happen again that the police are there
to protect people they are not there to kill children and women do you
have anything to say concerning this mr tsili and mr nombiba
according to my view i believe that a killer must be killed
because he is able to kill a person he has to be killed he is able to
kill human beings not animals there is nothing else i can think about a
killer he has to be killed as a law has to be passed because i dont
have a wife today i have to support my children i have to help myself
because i dont have a wife i have to prepare food for myself there is
nobody preparing food for me because those who were in government at the
time killed my wife even today when my wifes name is mentioned i feel
this is very difficult because the government is trying to
reconcile people although these people have done all these bad things to
us we are injured we have wounds inside because of what they have done
to us as black people they were killing us but there is a law passed by
the government the government doesnt want revenge and this is very
difficult my request is that as the government doesnt want revenge
these people have to be arrested have to be put in jail
thank you let me start with you nomangesi your mother
passed away she was trying to protect you i thank you for coming here
today to come and testify we hope that this will remain in your mind
that your mother sacrificed her life to protect you
	i want to thank your father he said harsh words but i think that he is
an example of men he is the father who showed that although his wife
passed away he can raise his seven children i can see that this incident
affected him as we are looking in his face it is clear that he was
injured inside it is easy for us as we are sitting here at the table to
talk about reconciliation and forgiveness because we did not experience
what you have experienced but we want to salute him and to give him
respect because he lost his wife you were still very young he managed
to try and raise you so that you can be where you are today
	to you mr nombiba we would like to thank you you said something i
think it is very painful that children did not tell us about their
involvement we found that many parents are not aware whether their
children died as heroes because at that time you couldnt go home and
tell your parents what you were involved in you did not want them to
expect you to be shot and to be in jail i think this is one of the
important things in this commission that old people like you at last
they would find the truth the truth about the struggle of their
children because they did not tell them what was happening
	what is important to me is that maybe the commission will give out a
report that will help you to go to your childrens graves to talk to
your children that you were not aware that they were fighting for their
country so that you can salute them
	we thank you for your testimony we promise that what you have given us
will be looked at especially the two different views you mentioned about
this reconciliation you may sit down thank you
welcome can you please introduce the lady who is with you
i welcome her too mr mabunda before you tell us our story
could you please stand to take the oath if you will just repeat after
me i swear that the story i’m about to tell is the truth the whole
truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
mr mabunda you’ve come to tell us about what happened to
your brother ken mabunda on the twenty eighth of march in
lulekane could you tell us that story very briefly
what happened on the twenty eighth of march in at
lulekane it was on a good friday before that date there was a problem
within the lulekane township there were these soldiers who were coming
from outside country they were staying in another secret camp just next
to our township those people before they came to our township it was
very quiet but after their arrival peace was no longer there these
people used to drink a lot and when they are drunk they were drunk they
used to go around the streets and started harassing people if they find
you during the evening they used to assault you to beat people up
without knowing the reason they used to assault us very badly the
community of lulekane more especially the youth we gathered together
and tried to discuss this problem to assist each other in order to
control the area because it was no longer safe we gathered and
discussed about these matters we assisted each other with ideas how we
could remove these people from our township they should no longer set
their foot in our township because it was no longer safe if they were
they were around the township we agreed on those points there is
nothing that we did to drive those people out of our township because we
tried to confront them at the beginning it was just a few of us who used
to go there sometimes other people youth used not to come
	so during that day that i’ve already mentioned in the evening we were
sitting in a shabeen enjoying ourselves there and then immediately a bomb
exploded in that particular place it was during the night no one
expected that a bomb would explode even myself i was in that particular
place i never heard a bomb exploding even a single day except that day
i used just to see it on films i was very scared people dispersed in
that area i didn’t run away myself i was inside and then i went out and
i was on the street after i heard that there were people who were
inside who were left there and my younger brother was also there and
then i went back to check what happened actually i found that the whole
place was damaged not even a single person whom i was together with
answered me some of them were screaming there was a fence behind the
fence some of them called m called me to assist them to give them help
and i didn’t know what to do by that time i was shocked i looked around
on the bodies i could not see my brother we left together with with
some two youths i went to report this matter at home when we arrived at
home we found that my my brother was not there too and we started
looking around for him we went to the hospital that time and to the
police station they said we cannot enter in the mortuary to check in
the government mortuary because we’re still very young they refused us
permission to enter until we got the help of reverend kwiniga then we
found him in the government mortuary you could not even recognize him
that’s what happened on that particular day
you said that there were these soldiers who came and
disturbed you know the life in lulekane where did they come from
actually these soldiers some of them were coming from
angola zimbabwe all these foreign countries they were not south
african citizens during that time the military bases which were there
it was and battalions and there was this battalion which they used
to called it skietoff or five rake it was just a secret base
why were they brought into lulekane what was happening in
lulekane at the time to warrant their presence there
actually in lulekane they came to township to drink there
if they were off duty their camp was just next to lulekane it was just
outside lulekane ten kilometers from lulekane they used to come to
lulekane to come and drink and do some other things
oh so they were not on duty patrolling the place they just
came to drink from their camp
when they come to lulekane it’s they were not patrolling
they were not on uniform they were just come there privately to come and
then why did you dislike their presence because you say
that several times you tried to confront them and how did you confront
what we used to do is that when we we find them being a
group we used to tell them that we don’t want them in our place we
don’t want them because they used to harass us when they used to find us
in the streets if they find you during the evening and even you are
walking with a girlfriend or a wife you will be assaulted beaten up and
they take your girlfriend or your wife and they will take your wife or
when they did this did you ever report to your police that
these soldiers were harassing you and your girlfriends or wives
i can say that maybe there were people who used to say that
but we never reported the matters to the police because some maybe
sometimes it could have ended but but there was no action which was
taken against them if ever the matter was reported by other people the
way these people used to do they were the people who were controlling
the whole area there was no other person who was going to do anything
with those people because they were controlling the area itself
now you say a group of comrades met at a shabeen to drink or
just to hold a meeting because in your statement you say that they had
planned this meeting and they used the shabeen as a venue did you think
perhaps they knew that you were going to meet there for a meeting was it
a meeting or just a social gathering
it was just a social gathering we were not discussing
anything just to build oness a amongst ourselves so that maybe if one
day if those people come and harass even one of our people in the
community we will assist each other it was a social gathering and at
the same time discussing those issues and during that time in our
township there was no police station there the police station was only
in town you have to go to town to report the matter so to be assisted
by the police it was not very easy
so you would say that in the absence of a police station in
lulekane the comrades saw that they could be the protectors of the of
yes sir i assume because they were the only people who were
there who could give assistance to the community of lulekane because if
a person tell you something and then you go to to the police station
you don’t know the people who were coming there these soldiers you can
even fail to point those people so it was very easy for us as the
committee of lulekane to protect each other
now do you think this bomb was planted there or was thrown
actually when they they came to to take the statements the
people the trc people the statement takers that’s when we started
seeing the photo’s from the scene and the photo of a hand grenade so a
hand grenade according to my own understanding is something which you can
throw i don’t know whether it was planted or it was thrown it exploded
while while i was standing on the other street along the street but
hand grenade according to my understanding is that you throw a hand
and before this bomb blast did you see any people passing
that area i mean it was very busy people were moving to
and to and from there were people who were standing there there were
people who were passing along the street i cannot differentiate between
the people who standing and people who were passing actually after it
it exploded there were people who were driving motorbikes and those
motor those people used to drive those motorbikes
so you saw the motor bikes just shortly after the bomb and
the the soldiers usually used to use motorbikes did the soldiers use
motorbikes when they came to lulekane
yes yes they used to use my motorbikes a lot of them some
of them used their own vehicles when you see a very beautiful car it
was their own car there were people who came there and they found us
staying there in lulekane what the government was doing to them it was
it was amazing they were doing it a lot of things for them than they do
for and battalion there was nothing they were afraid of that
was one of the issues which gave us problems
in your statement you say that many people were killed do
you know exactly the number of people who were killed in that shabeen on
no i can’t tell you the number of people who died during
that day there was many people who died there were at least five but
some of them i don’t know them
but all the people who died were the comrades that used to
discuss the issue of the mercenaries with you
yes i can say so there were other people who were staying
in namakyale who were there too
was there an official investigation about this bomb blast
afterwards in lulekane by the police or by the soldiers
actually if there was any inquest they should have come to
me because i was there i was the the witness whether there was an
inquest or not i don’t know but what happened later is that there was
some people who went to to court to appear in court and complainants
were promised to be called to court since right until now not even
a single complainant was called until we started enquiring from the
magistrate this new government we thought maybe the trc could assist us
just to respond to what you just said now about that the trc
could possibly assist you this is actually one of the cases were our
investigators have already started work we have the files and the
documents it was a hand grenade which was thrown into this shabeen in
fact there are people who were witnesses to this who actually saw
certain individuals moving around the place just before this explosion
they’ve actually given the names of these people our investigators have
been in in contact with the relevant police stations with the army
structures there was in the beginning an investigation into this matter
from the side of the police but it was it was not taken through to
completion and and we are actually following up on that and we are
hoping to certainly before the end of the life of the commission to be
able to get some answers and and in particular to speak to the
individuals who were seen around the place and who were and who were
known to be part of the army just before the hand grenade was thrown into
well in the light of what dr ally has said i have no
sorry owen i just want to know how you say your brother was
in standard seven how old was he
actually he was born in i was trying to calculate
in your statement you you state how this has affected you
and your family that even up to this day you feel that you were
responsible for his death can you just tell us a little more about that
or you feel that you were responsible
actually the death of my brother affected the whole family
firstly he was never buried he was never given a proper funeral it was
just donations from people from our area the youth those people who
were sympathizing with us we never had money at home to bury him
properly i personally i feel that if i was the one who was killed by
the bomb he was still very young i thought maybe it was going to better
if the bomb killed me because he was still at school me as his brother
his elder brother i should not have allowed him to be involved in all
this things he died there’s nothing that i’m doing now to make him
happy where he’s where he’s sleeping now i’m even failing to to buy
him a tombstone just to remember him you see actually it’s painful for
me it’s painful for me really
when you refer to what would you think of the other four or
the otherr five who died with him would they too deserve tombstones or a
actually i think it proper because those people were
friends actually they were my friend my friends too all what was
happening in in lulekane it involved them because it was just a
township which was had just been formed i think one of them could have
been a premier now so i think it’s better if a memorial for them is
built because they died for one cause
thank you very much owen this is really a very tragic story
because there were five young people most of them under the age of
twenty who were killed in in in that incident and as i said to you
earlier it’s one of the cases which we are investigating and where there
are some very strong leads and we hope that if we are able to answer some
of these questions they will will help you to to come to terms with
what happened and as mr manthata has implied in in the questions that
he’s asked you this is one of the concerns of the reparation and
rehabilitation committee is how to restore the memory and the dignity of
victims of gross human rights violations so what you have said i’m
sure mr manthata will certainly be taking this to to his committee
thank you very much for for coming to speak to us about this event
will you do that one joyce 
good afternoon i also greet you
could you please introduce the young man who is with you
he’s the young man i’m travelling with
thank you very much mr matidza in respect of your age i’m
not going to let you stand but can you just repeat after me the oath i
swear that the story i’m about to tell is the truth the whole truth and
nothing but the truth so help me god
mr matidza could you tell us your story
it was during those previous times i used to go about with
these freedom fighters or the people fighting for freedom as i was doing
that in that process i he was in trouble because most of the white
race of people and some of our fellow people blacks were not interested
	it so happened that i was once involved i was once a victim of arrest
as i was arrested they took me the court i was really troubled because
in amongst the people when i was released i was again i was referred to
a cell when i was just alone they gave me food just as i was there it
was just full of dirt a smelling room i discovered that i couldn’t eat
	the following morning just at the dining hall for porridge and
breakfast i will i was able to eat better there as i was there as i
was in the cell i suffered a great deal so much that you know they
used to choke me and i fainted as they were really choking me or
electrifying me they were interrogating me they wanted me to say exactly
if at all i was one of the freedom fighters the socalled terrorists i
responded as follows i am working hand in hand with them well i’ve not
been to those socalled terrorists but i’m working hand in hand with
them they asked me if i could tell them if i tell them who the people
are the ones who used to visit but i told them they were the church
people and sometimes they were just ordinary people who come for meetings
for freedom fighters that is where i really incited them and they hated
	however i sat there up to the time when they released me on on sixty
five rand bail that’s the bail money well it happened again two men
came one of them was titi ramabrana and the other one was jacobus
ramabrana they were two they had guns it was late evening i was
already asleep after i had dinner they asked from my children my
children said the old man is asleep that is when you know they went
straight to my room and my son followed them as they approached they
knocked they knocked several times on the door and i responded as
follows who are you and they said police i said how what kind of
a police why do you come late in the evening are they cleaning us
here one they said just open police well i opened happily i was
not feeling any guilty i just opened slowly nicely and then i went back
to may bed oh well as an innocent person i wasn’t frightened at all
just then they stood beside my bed as they were just doing like that my
son was just there they asked him who he was and then he said i belong
here they wrote few things and i just don’t know what they were doing
and they just commanded and said no he’s going to the court tomorrow i
said okay fine that is when they left there with those guns they were
	i went to the court well i was on the witness box they told me that i
was there because there are these socalled terrorists and i said well i
don’t know i cannot even point a finger at where they are i’m just a
member of the socalled freedom fighters organisation but i don’t know
who the terrorists are then i was referred to the cells when i was
taken to the cells i was beaten severely they were shocking me with
electric now there was one thing that really hit me on the back i
don’t know that kind of object even my bone here at the back on my left
handside is still broken and swollen sort of i fell down i was just
groaning you know you can see i’m an elderly person i even cried as
i’m saying here now my eyes are really about to shed some tears
	however they took me to the cells right at the cells those police were
really assaulting me i don’t know how to explain this they were just
insisting on finding out who and where were those terrorists i told them
the same thing that i didn’t know them i only told them that the people
who came to me are some of the people i usually attend meetings with them
at the councils i’m still with them however fighting for the freedom
i’m still fighting for the freedom undoubtedly so that’s when they
said they were to say the following morning i’ll be meeting a white man
who seemingly was in charge of the police station as i was in the
witness box he said to me please leave the old man leave go for home
then i left well i was so guilty because i was not given a chance to
say whatever they were worried of
	i left i left for home they sent a van a big van you know they just
took all the people who were at home they were about seven women and i
was the eighth person including those who were visiting just there i
was referred to the cells and i was asked to tell them exactly where the
terrorists were and i told them i didn’t know anything and they said
please be careful you must really realise that you are you said
something bad about the police since those people were very innocent
they just agreed and they got a fine of sixty five rand just then when
we had been fined i was the only one who was left they ran home and
fetched the money we don’t even know where this money was taken to no
one knows exactly what happened with reference to this money no but
they just signed the people who were at the local police station didn’t
want to sign we stayed there for some time until some few police guys
came i know of one who that was jacobus ramabrana they were just
assaulting us beating us again and just shouting abusive words we
didn’t want to be evicted now they arrested me alone he just wanted to
finish me off with a gun he shot using his gun and then it fell on on
my leg and he said no i was just releasing my gun please be careful i
	so we left i was just going there to explain the same severe torture
with you know the materials that they were using shocking materials
and i just fell again and i was unconscious during the course of the
matter i had to come back so i was told that my property was going to
be taken my fields and again i had fertilised my fields and somebody was
given that field of mine even my wife’s field was taken it was given to
somebody else during that time we were just left with a very little
orchard at home that is the one we only depended on that is when it was
discovered that they were saying i had to leave i had to be evicted
since i was born there i said okay fine i’ve got i’ve got twelve huts
and i also have my trees if ever i realise that you are going to build
some twelve huts in whichever place you are taking me that’s fine
however i need compensation about my trees that is where they failed to
	so again i suffered some difficulties because i was said to be or
alleged to be the one who organising these vip’s it was a terrible thing
altogether i was tortured however there was this vip and the national
party then i was organizing for the vip because it was a progressive
party so that they should get some freedom some kind of freedom just
there it was a difficult thing for them even up to now the current
moment they just because it’s a new democratic government they look at
me as a very good person i’ve i know my enemies look at me
indifferently they wish me dead that’s over
according to your statement here ndade matidza you were born
in am i correct to assume that you interrupted 
so you probably are how old are you now about 
in when you went through all these problems you were
about you were in your ’s
well i just didn’t calculate that i only know when i was
so you must have been in your ’s when you went through
this i must say you are a very strong man and it’s amazing at that age
you should have been a threat to the then government okay now you
according to your statement you were arrested three times
they came to fetch you and you were released 
and then they came to fetch you and then the third time
what was your political affiliation at that time 
i belong to the progressive the one where madiba is
so that is the anc am i correct 
well it was not that officially recognised as an anc we
just knew it as a progressive government i mean party
and the third time you were arrested you say that chief
ramabulani harassed you because you voted for the vip party what did you
well i was the organiser of the vip
let me correct myself you were a member of the vip party
what did you have against the ramabrana’s party the national party 
well we have suffered a lot because those people were mixed
and if they were mixed with white and boers what is it that
they did that you thought was wrong
they used to really give us problems no they just arrested
us assaulting us no there was nothing very good no there was no
money now it’s it’s better because we get some few bucks
where you in favour of the venda homeland government 
no because they used to torture us they were troublesome
did they finally evict you from your place or are you still
i was never evicted i just said to myself let them kill me
tate you have said a number of times when you in the arrest
that took place and you were tortured they were asking you about the
help that you were giving to socalled terrorists were you actually
assisting these socalled terrorists and what were you doing if you were 
well regarding the socalled terrorists no they were not
really terrorists they are just they were just ordinary people who were
really helping in organising inasfar as the freedom was concerned to
okay i understand you thank you
tata thank you thank you very much as my fellow colleague has
already indicated you have lived through so much and you have survived so
much and i think it must be for you it must be a real personal triumph
to know that you outlived all of these systems which attempted to oppress
and repress you you outlived the apartheid system you outlived the
homelands system and you are now able to live in this new democracy and
that must be a real tribute and you must feel personally vindicated that
throughout all of these years you remain true to this belief of yours
and people the rights of people the need for people to enjoy democracy
and not to have governments forced on them which they did not agree with
	thanks for coming and for sharing with us and we will certainly be
getting in touch with you regard to your particular case your torture
and the gross human rights violation which you personally suffered thank
thank you very much too sorry sorry he was still asking
what about the compensation about the fields that i lost
what about that is there anything that can be done about that well the
torture and all those things that i experienced 
as we have said to all the other people who have come forward
there is a committee which is known as the committee on reparations and
rehabilitation and it is this committee that is going to make
recommendations to the president and to parliament and it is through the
recommendations of this committee that a policy will be put into place to
assist those who have suffered gross human rights violations
unfortunately however this will come at the end of the work of the
commission because we have to listen to all cases and have to hear from
all the witnesses all victims before we know what exactly it is that the
government needs to do in regard to with regard to things that have
happened to people so we will just ask you to please be a little bit
patient but if there are urgent issues with regard to your health that
you need urgent that needs urgent attention then you can communicate
that to our to our staff to our briefers because there is an urgent
interim relief policy for those kinds of cases but in terms of the long
term reparation that will come at the end of the life of the commission
however i’m not of that good health when i’m here i think
i’m i’m not these people really tortured me they assaulted me i think
my health is not that good
for that reason i’m going to ask that our briefers who are here
with us today they will speak to you now and i’m sure that they will be
able to assist you in getting medical attention or directing you to a
place where you can get this medical attention for your health so as
soon as you leave the stage i’m sure that our briefers zodwa and also
fikele will to assist you but thank you very much
mr mbalati good afternoon we are very glad that you could
come we know that you are not well so we won’t keep you too long if
you’ll just stand to take the oath if you can just repeat after me i
swear that the story i’m about to tell is the truth the whole truth and
nothing but the truth so help me god
mr mbalati who has accompanied you the one on your 
it’s andrew hlongwane it’s a friend
mr mbalati i would like that we take our story guiding one
another i see here according to your statement you were detained with
isaac ditsego in alexandra do you still remember when this was 
and you were taken to sandton can you tell us how you were
in alexandra so isaac ditsego was one of the operatives of
mk and then he was under a very serious surveillance so the following
day after i have arrived at his place the police came looking for isaac
ditsego it was about ten o’clock so together with isaac we were
discussing politics of the anc and by that day i was coming from a doctor
somewhere in naledi then i was supposed to be taken and moved out from
my isaac ditsego’s place unfortunately the people who were to take me
away from isaac ditsego’s place delayed then the police came it was at
about one am well they arrived in numbers they knocked the door was
opened so isaac came out from his bedroom they began by inquiring a lot
of information from isaac while asking him a lot of questions he was
beaten up brutally while some were busy with isaac they some turned to
me they wanted to know who am i and why i was at his isaac’s place
well i claimed that i was his cousin and i paid a visit since it was june
during school holidays but they were not convinced they suspected i was
a terrorist so i refused however they started dealing with me
brutally the same way they were beating isaac ditsego
	after a long time were taken to alexandra police station together with
isaac from alexandra we were taken to sandton police station where we
were detained but to my surprise a lot of comrades were arrested with a
very short space of time so during the process there at sandton the
police were not yet having a very good information about myself whether
i belonged to the unit of isaac ditsego and his comrades or not so
torture began the following day because they demanded to know a lot of
informations about some of the operations which were carried out by
nchabaleng unit so i wasn’t not interested about anything concerning
the operations of the unit nchabaleng so the police thought that maybe
i was hiding they said now you are not cooperative then you don’t even
know how to behave in the process of interrogation so if you don’t
cooperate we are going to deal with you brutally so there was a
problem because isaac had never been informed by myself that i will
claim that i’m i was his cousin so there was a clear difference
between myself and isaac i had never known what isaac told the police as
far as our relationship was concerned so i was in trouble because they
had a more they were very much suspicious since they were interrogating
myself i was telling a different story isaac was also telling a
different story it is just unfortunate that i cannot explain each and
every detail specifically on a point how i was actually tortured
okay don’t worry yourself about that then you were taken
to john vorster square do you still remember 
were you still with did you know that ditsego could have
been at john vorster square with you at the time 
no i did not know that
do you still remember how long you were kept at john vorster
you can’t remember and then you were brought over to
duiwelskloof do you remember how you were brought back to duiwelskloof 
were you taken to duiwelskloof police station or were you
i was taken to duiwelskloof police station
and do you remember how long you could have been kept at
no i can’t remember but but i stayed there for quite a long
and during that time could your family visit you 
ja there was a time when when i was given the chance to
did the family ever talk about having instructed a lawyer on
out of these three detentions how did you eventually feel
body wise mind wise you know were you still as strong and ablebodied
no i’m having a serious problem
can you relate to us what the problem is take time
i discovered that i’m now suffering from a short memory and
secondly on my left on my left shoulder there is a permanent pain and
then physically i always feel weak i cannot walk long distances which i
used to walk before basically that is how i feel nowdays
and when you were released from duiwelskloof police station
were you ever taken to a doctor 
ja i once had been taken to a doctor somewhere in
yes can you remember which year this was 
who had taken you to the doctor could it have been the
comrades or could it have been the sacc detainees group you know we
used to have those groups that cared for the people who were either in
detention or who had just come out of detention
i was taken by alec nchawalene and chris maake
i see and you don’t remember where they took you to that
is the doctor who examined you
you can’t remember where sorry are you still staying
are both your parents still alive 
can we say that they are taking good care of you 
i would say yes but they are having they are doing it i
yes i think it has to be because you are in a position
where you would love to be free independent and do your own thing but i
think that should be understood do you understand why it has to be so 
i can’t understand the last statement
okay i was saying you were saying yes under duress or
could you say what you mean by that under duress 
i’m unemployed presently so i eat anything they buy and then
i eat more than that yes
thank you stranger i have no further question to raise i
give it back to the chairperson
jabulani can you just tell us what were you doing at the
time of your arrest in alex in were you working at the time 
where were you studying and what were you studying 
i was at bankuna high doing matric
okay and i just want to know maybe i’ve i missed it as as
mr manthata was asking you questions or when you were talking you said
at the time of your arrest with isaac there were many other comrades when
you went to sandton police station first of all what happened to isaac
ditsego and what happened to the other comrades 
as far as i know isaac ditsego and his unit were released
since there were negotiations between the government and the anc they
were given short of an indemnity or they were granted bail
can i ask this last question you said you went to visit
isaac and in the statement there’s some mention of the nchabaleng unit of
mk were you involved in that yourself 
no in fact i wasn’t part of nchabaleng unit in fact i was
running away from home whereby we carried out some operations
sorry i didn’t hear that last part you were running away
since i was involved here at home with a unit of our own here
stranger thank you very much for coming we can all see what
the consequences of your torture has been and again i can just repeat
what i’ve already said that that is one of the areas that the committee
that mr manthata serves on the rehabilitation and reparations committee
is looking at very very closely is what kind of assistance can be
provided to to people like yourself both for urgent relief and also the
more long term policy on reparations and they have already forwarded a
policy document an urgent interim relief which is which is being
discussed this will be submitted to the government and they are working
on a long term policy but in the immediate term our briefers and one is
sitting at the table that they are in contact with many community
organizations with many government organizations with nongovernmental
organisations and i’m sure that they will be able to direct you to some
place where you could go in the immediate term for some form of
assistance whether it be counselling or whether it be in the form of some
kind of medical help but thank you very much for coming and for bringing
your case to the commission and i hope that we will be able to that we
will be able to respond to your needs quite soon thank you very much
	that brings us to the end of the hearings for the northern province but
before people start getting up and wanting to move i’ll ask you just to
be a little patient with us for a few more minutes there are a couple of
announcements we need to make and a couple of people we need to thank and
we are then going to ask father mc carthy to close the session with a
prayer so if you would just bear with us for a few more moments i’m
going to ask mr manthata just to speak very very briefly about the
followup meeting which we’re going to be having in pietersberg for the
northern province in may which will be a very important meeting i’ll ask
mr manthata just to speak to that very quickly
thank you mr chair we shall be having a followup meeting
that is after this exercise of hearing we would love to hear in
collective form from the people about their experiences their
expectations and to even acquaint them with the document that we so
repeatedly referred to that is the document on reparations as we are
going as we have already submitted it to the government but even then it
is still a draft because we have to get the opinions of the people right
through the country what they think or what they consider adequate
measures for reparation so on the rd of may the whole of the northern
province will be holding a meeting in pietersberg where we shall be
expecting to hear from them what reparation processes will be due to them
and of course one other sensitive area as we keep talking about here is
whether there would be possibilities of just initiating or talking about
the likelihood of reconciliation it’s not going to be reconciliation
itself as you will bear in mind that we are not talking about a cheap
reconciliation and for that matter it will be observed that
reconciliation is going to be a process a process that is based on
knowledge of the facts of what happened to our relatives of what
happened to our brothers and sisters and who did what to them and what
his intentions were so that we talk of reconciliation in very specific
	and it should be borne in mind that when we talk about reconciliation in
the context of the truth and reconciliation commission is largely
reconciliation between the blacks and the whites but we know that it is
still very difficult to reach the whites i don’t even think that it is
because it is that difficult but they are still undergoing a process of
self knowledge self reassessment and of course that means knowledge of
what other people are that is why some of them are still grappling with
the problem of how to understand the truth and reconciliation commission
because some of them believe that it’s a witchhunt some of them believe
that it is calculated to put the black people at a high moral ground
compared to them and this still gives them a lot of problems but
otherwise the most important thing at that workshop is people will be
made acquainted and knowledgeable about the reparation processes that are
going to be submitted to the government and later what to expect from the
	we keep saying that the truth and reconciliation commission does not
operate on a cheque book what we do is to find the needs of the people
more especially what the people would love to have the government do for
them and then we submit that to the government it is the government that
is going to materialise that is going to implement all what you and
others shall have proposed to be the ideal way of reparating the people
for the sufferings they have sustained during the years of conflict
thank you very much on behalf of my colleagues here at the
table dr randera mr manthata and miss joyce seroke we’d like to say
thank you very much to the people of the northern province the
volunteers those who assisted in the process of statement taking those
who assisted us to get to the witnesses and bringing witnesses to the
hearings those who assisted as briefers as counsellors those who
assisted with transport the police who provided security the media
both the national media and the local media which have covered these
	these have been three very difficult days we’ve heard very many
accounts of very severe violations we began in messina and then we moved
to louis trichardt today we’re here in tzaneen there it is quite
clear to us that there are still many many scars of this conflict we’ve
seen that a lot of the conflict in this area in particular had to do with
the imposition of the homeland system that how that system divided
communities tore communities apart that those that actually resisted
found themselves imprisoned found their property being destroyed found
themselves being forced into exile that the youth were forced to come
forward to try and defend communities that many youth actually also left
the country that this part of the country was also a place where people
left to go and join the liberation movement in exile to go and join mk
it was also an area a point at which they entered came back into the
country and there were many casualties many deaths during this process
of leaving and coming back into the country all of this has helped us to
gain a much better understanding of the nature of the conflict that by
having these hearings and by coming to these areas we actually get a
more human understanding and a more concrete understanding of what
happened in our past that we see the people face to face we see the
survivors we see the victims because very often these accounts of the
conflicts are in books and books don’t always convey the emotions and the
suffering and books also sometimes tend to shut out the voices of the
	so these hearings they provide that opportunity for the victims to come
forward and for their voices to be heard and for the experiences to be
shared not only with their communities but with the country as a whole
i want to appeal to those who made statement but who did not appear at
the public hearings not to feel that they have in any way been slighted
that their statements as we say repeatedly are as important as the
statements of those who appear publicly that we would really love to
have everybody appear at a public hearing but that unfortunately is
impossible we don’t have the time we don’t have the resources so we
have to select cases which give us an indication of the kinds of
violations which were taking place which give us some insight into the
conflict of that period and that’s the basis on which we choose
statements not because we think that some people’s cases are more
important than others i want to appeal to people then to continue making
statements there are statement takers in this region there are
designated statement takers we also have statement takers if people
want to know how to make statements they can contact any member of staff
of the commission at the end of the hearing end of tape
 and it makes it’s recommendations with
regard to a policy for victims of gross human rights violations so
people please understand how important it is for you to make statements
we can only work with the statement which we receive so if that process
can continue that will assist us greatly in our work
	once again thank you very much hope you have a safe journey back home
and i hope that many of you can come to our followup meeting in
pietersberg i’m now going to ask father mc carthy if he will close the
proceedings with a prayer thank you
before the prayer i would like to say that our bishop
inaudible regrets not being here today because i know when the truth
commission started he was head over heals about it and i’m sorry he’s not
here but still he’s still working on it and he wishes you every success
and he prays for you that god will enlighten you people in the commission
in the task that still has to be done
farther mc carthy closes with a prayer
thank you very much and i would have to end it was remiss of me
not thank your own staff for all the work that they have done and thank
you very much father and will people please leave the headsets behind
our next witness is komane molapo komane molapo
mr molapo good morning can you hear me clearly 
thank you mr molapo could you please stand to take the oath
before i could stand up i’d like to correct a name it’s not
thank you will you just repeat after me i swear that the
story i’m about to tell is the truth the whole truth and nothing but
the truth so help me god
thank you komape we heard that people shot you not because
they intended to shoot you you just happened to be the victim because
you were there what we call cross fire could you please explain to us
shortly how how it happened that you got shot at the time
the youth have had a meeting just a week before good friday at
namagale church before they dispersed as they were dispersing one car
hit one of the youths and the youths started to attack that car they hit
one soldier and the other soldiers were able to run away to their camps
after those kids left they thought the one that soldier had died they
went home but the others went to one hotel at namagale
	when they arrived just some few minutes after they arrived i came to
the hotel too when i arrived there i was trying to speak to the
employees of the hotel and they didn’t want to listen to me and those
kids tried to explain what happened that day to those women at the
hotel after a while we heard a gun shot which broke the doors at the
reception of the hotel and the glasses were all over i think it was
three gun shots and the door broke down and after a while a handgrade
grenade was thrown into the hotel i did not understand actually what hit
me on my back whether it was a handgrenade or the gun shot i fell down
but i could walk and i hid under a sofa
	from six in the evening until twelve i was seated there and after a
while i heard some noises in the hotel i crawled to those people and
they happened to see me they were there seated with the owner of the
hotel and he managed to take us to the hospital
	what happened again that day is that there were other people who were
with me there and they he was one of them was shot and he died
instantly and that one was taken to the mortuary too and the others were
taken to the hospital when we arrived at the hospital we found that
they had arranged a doctor a standby doctor for us and they tried to
give me first aid and when the other people who dropped me at the hotel
wanted to go back i said i was leaving with them because i was
frightened that the soldiers would come back to kill us they assured me
that there was security at the hospital and that’s when i accepted that i
	i stayed at the hospital for a week and i was released after that and i
went home i used to go to the hospital to receive treatment and i was i
could go back to work i could only work for a week because i started to
get sick again and my finger could not heal properly and i was supposed
to go back to the hospital and they cut it off they amputated it
	after a while i was approached by lebowa police and they were asking me
to be a state witness what they told me is that the owner of the hotel
was trying to test whether his handgrenades were working that’s how it
	on the day of the trial they only called the hotel manager’s employees
to be other witnesses and i waited to be called but i was never called
until today i don’t know if i should proceed to case number two
it was in in january i cannot remember well the date but
it was on saturday i went to that hotel but i was going to the bottle
store i was with a friend of mine and we were looking for some drinks
there when i wanted to buy some drinks some policemen approached me and
there were many of them more that twenty policemen from lebowa they
said to me they were looking for me and that i should leave that place
and they promised that they will release me to go back and buy my drinks
i went with them to go and talk with them
	when we got outside i realised that almost all the police cars were
there to fetch me they put me into their car and they took me to their
police station they put me at their reception at their station and they
were ignoring me and but they were helping other people at the station
at around past five they asked me what i knew about the people’s court i
told them that i knew nothing about the police people’s court and i told
them i didn’t even know what animal was that one and they told me that
they heard that i was the magistrate for that people’s court i told them
that i wanted to see that person who reported that i was the magistrate
of that people’s court that i did not know anything about i was left in
a room with only three policemen and the fourth one came in to guard me
at the back and the fifth one came again to stop the other entrance which
went into the other cells they asked me to lie down so that they could
beat me up i told them they were not going to beat me up they tried to
beat me with sjamboks and i was just quiet and they started kicking me
and beating me up with fists only three policemen were beating me up
the other two were just guarding me and they told me that if i could
beat them back they were going to kill me i was just blocking their
fists and their kicks so that they could not hit me on my private parts
but they were beating me up they were kicking me and until they got
tired like chickens they were all tired of beating me up because i was
	at the end they took me to the other cell and all what was left was the
buttons of my shirt they put me there for the weekend and i was hoping
that on monday they would take me to trial they left me inside at the
waiting room for the whole day and they didn’t take my papers to the
magistrate they could not allow people to come to see me they tried to
the community tried to look for a lawyer and at last my wife and my
relatives were able to to see me and on thursday of that week they
released me they actually didn’t release me they took me to trial but
at the court they didn’t want me to say anything i tried to raise my
hand to ask the magistrate to give me free bail so that i could and
consult the doctor he said no i borrowed a shirt from one guy and i
took it off and i showed him how badly i was injured and i could only
treat those injuries with the green soap and and water they they
released me so that i could consult a doctor
	from there i went to their station commander to open up a case it took
him a week and he was quiet but the second week he asked me to point who
was torturing me i pointed the policemen and he promised that he’ll call
me to come to trial up to today they never called me i’m still waiting
	i have a third case it was in in january i also don’t remember
the date but it was on monday i went to phalaborwa town i was wearing a
tshirt which had names of sisulu and his comrades i went to a bank and
i was going to a nearby shop and two white men came to me running the
other one grabbed me with my tshirt and the other grabbed my belt as i
was trying to see and ask them what was wrong they showed me their police
identity cards they took me to their station they took me to their
	when we arrived there there were only two black policemen they said
they must go out there was a tv in that little office cassettes and
some machines in there they said i should take off my shirt and they
started questioning me about the anc i told them that they could ask me
about cosatu or chemical industrial union but i knew nothing about the
anc they said why are you wearing this tshirt don’t you know it
	in that room the all the other guys were asking me about shangaan the
other insebedi the other english the other in afrikaans the other one
was asking me in funikalore at the same time and they wanted me to
answer all their questions at the same time the other guy i think he
was their senior in phalaborwa he was threatening me telling me that i
should know that i would never see my wife again my friends and that i
will never go back to work again and that that was my day i laughed at
him he started getting angry and he pointed me with a finger and say
why are you laughing at me i said you could do anything but i will meet
him in heaven they tried to ask me those funny questions until this guy
from phalaborwa phoned i think he phoned jo’burg offices i overheard
his conversation that he was agreeing to whatever they were telling him
that there were lots of those tshirts in my area and where they took me
there were other guys who were wearing those tshirts but i think i was
just unfortunate that’s why i was taken to the station
	later on they called a black colleague of theirs they put back that
tshirt on the other side as if i was a mad person and they took me to
namagale to my house so that i should change that tshirt and give it to
them i told serfontein about that case because he he was our lawyer
here in the northern province it took him only two weeks and he sent me
a letter telling me that he’s talked to the other boer policeman and that
boer told him that he took the matter to pretoria and he told him that
pretoria could only tell them whether i’m guilty or not that was the end
thank you komape don’t you have the fourth case according
to the third case did they take you to the police station
they took me to their offices not the it’s not the police
how how many hours did they keep you there
i think it’s for about three to four hours
where they called peoples magistrates how long did they
i think it’s for about two to three hours because they only
left beating me they only left after they got tired
after they tortured you did you go to the doctor 
yes i consulted the doctor after a week because i was kept in
after beating you did they take you to their cell 
how long did they keep you in a cell 
it’s for about a week because i was arrested on saturday and
at the time were you unemployed because you could not work
were you a member of the union 
thanks in your first case when these youths were at the
hotel talking to the employees of the hotel were you able to hear what
they were discussing about the incident where one of their
colleagues was hit by the police car
not tranlated who this comrade was
i did not know actually i could not understand what
happened because i had just arrived at the hotel and i was trying to
approach the employees and they told me to wait a little bit because they
were trying to discuss what happened
who was the owner of the hotel 
they way i heard you explaining i think you said john
mogodi was manufacturing handgrenades or bombs
yes they told us that he was testing the handgrenades
actually they didn’t say the handgrenades it was the police who were
yes only for a day when they called me to testify that was
this the other kid who was shot dead what’s the name of
i don’t know his name and i didn’t know where he he was
staying because i was at the hospital too at the time and when i came
even at the time of the funeral were you at the hospital 
yes i was still at the hospital
mr molapo let’s just get some clarification on this first
incident people are standing in the hotel one person gets shot three
handgrenades are thrown you say and the hotel owner gets charged is that
what you’re telling us was he charged for the bombing in the hotel that
could you please repeat the question 
i’m saying that in your statement when you arrived at the
hotel there were the youths talking about what had happened in the street
with the soldiers soon after that one of the youths gets shot in the
hotel somebody shoots from outside then you also say that three
handgrenades are thrown into the hotel but the person who gets charged
for the incident is the hotel owner am i understanding that rightly 
yes you understood me well the hotel owner was charged but
it was just only to confuse other people it that was not the case
so in your opinion it was somebody else that was doing the
shooting and the throwing of the grenades
i think it was those soldiers i think it was the soldiers who
used to patrol our streets it’s them who did who through those
handgrenades because at the same time there i don’t think lebowa police
had handgrenades they only had teargasses
okay i just want to go to the second incident quickly and
that this is not taking away what happened to you in terms of the torture
that the police committed against you can you tell us something about
these youth people’s courts either because you were directly involved
in them yourself or your understanding of what they did from living in
the community what were they doing 
about the people’s court i knew nothing because the day when
i went to trial this other guy who was with me in the cell i only got
surprised on the day of the trial when he was asked whether he knew me
he said yes but then i was i knew nothing about the youth people’s
okay the question is related to something you said about the
militarisation in the area and the existence of namibian askaris can you
just tell us something a little about that 
i didn’t say anything about the soldiers at our place what i
said was that there were youths who held a meeting at the day when i got
injured and when as they were dispersing soldiers the soldiers came
and they hit other youth with their car and the youths started attacking
those soldiers and they started running and that’s when when they came
back nobody saw how many soldiers were there i think maybe it was only
one two or ten nobody knew because it was already late in the evening
and we were inside the hotel and they were outside
thank you very much for that statement this is also another one
of those cases where we’re hoping to be able to find some answers
another handgrenade case and it seems from the little bit of
investigation that has already started that the questions need to be
directed to the then south african defence force and as i said as i
mentioned about with regard to the previous case our investigators are
following up on these matters and your statement does help them in that
work so thank you very much and when we do get some answers we will
certainly let you know even if we don’t get answers we will also let you
know but thank you very much for coming forward it has already gone ten
to twelve i think we’ll take a break now for tea and i’m going to ask
people if they could please be back by ten past twelve and if you can
please leave the headsets behind and when you come back from tea you can
we’ll break for lunch now and we’ll come back at two o’clock so
we’ll come back at two o’clock thank you
we’ll ask our next witness if mthebule ignatius samuel
our next witness is samuel mthebule
mr do you want to put your headphones on or not 
english he’s going to use english
good afternoon mr mthebule welcome mr mthebule would you
please stand to take the oath if you can just repeat after me i swear
that the story i’m about to tell is the truth the whole truth and
nothing but the truth so help me god
welcome mr mthebule would you introduce the person who’s
he is my uncle a brother to my father his name is abel
you’ve come to tell us about your brother ignatius mthebule
who left the country in would you tell us about him and why he had
basically there isn’t really much that i that i know why he
left the country as i should submit from the 
so should i start again alright thank you much as i said
before that i have no idea 
i don’t have much as to why he had to leave the country but
all i know is that in in yes he went to the university of
the north where he studied for his bcomm degree since our father
passed away some years back i as his elder brother had to act as his
guardian and in he was expelled from the university of the north on
the accusation that he participated in the socalled mozambique
independence celebrations being regarded as one of the instigators as a
if one could use that term of that time of this demonstration so as
his guardian and as his father standing in his father’s stead i had to
go to the university of the north where i pleaded for his readmission
	but some two or three three years later was it or i can’t
recall well he once more found himself in a position where he had to
leave the university of the north with a number of his comrades if one
could i quote one or two maku ramathlodi tom kwane and others who had
to leave because of their perceived their pressure by university
authorities he was at my knowledge a member of a student movement then
called azaso where he played a leading role as this movement’s spokesman
he was so oft quoted in the press that as to what was really happening
one had to rely mainly on press reports since because of the fear of
harassment he had go underground as one could call it that for most of
the time he was staying with his sister who is married in johannesburg
and then later on what we learnt as a family that he had left the
country was through the press again which we saw in the sowetan where
there was a caption that he had to leave the country because he was
constantly harassed by the police as to where he gone to we definitely
did not know but we had a very strong suspicion that he had joined the
african national congress and the link we had or communication we had
with him had been up to his disappearance through two letters
unaddressed of course which gave us an indication that he was still
alive but through some clandestine type of arrangement i met i had to
meet him organised by the african national congress somewhere in
johannesburg but it was a night meeting which had to take place at night
and that was the last i saw of him
	and i think it or where it was said this i didn’t get from him
but that is the report that i later got that he was operating within the
country as commander of the northern of the transvaal mk military unit
what but that was all and well we were satisfied that he was involved
in the struggle and our brother was still alive
	but now with the unbanning of the liberation movements and the return of
the exiles we also had you know that great expectation looking
expecting that at one time or another our brother would come back exiles
were already returning and we tried to enquire from the comrades who were
returning from exile as to his whereabouts but unfortunately there was
very little that we would get from them to confirm that he was alive so
i must make a submission here that immediately after the unbanning of the
african national congress and other liberation movements we tried as a
family to contact the african national congress through it’s regional
structures provincial structures and ultimately through the national
structure that we made an appointment with the african national congress
at shell house where my uncle here my wife and her cousin a certain
cousin matale met members of the african national congress at shell
house and that i think was in january because we were becoming now
concerned that there was nothing really that we were hearing of our child
as a family and of our brother
	so we met a delegation if i should call it of the african national
congress where we met mr jacob zuma makora ramathlodi who was then not
their premier and a certain lady whom i knew as comrade sue so we would
definitely wanted to find out what the position was so we made our
submission they went through their records as to those who disappeared
those who died in action and very little came by way of evidence from
such a let me call it inspection because for lack of a term
	but it was ultimately brought to our mind mr zuma makora ramathlodi
and the lady there gave us this version of all they knew about his
disappearance and ultimately now his assumed death that he had to meet
while in the country but before the unbanning of the liberation
movements he had to meet a certain comrade called joy hayden somewhere
between tembisa and eldorado park where perhaps they had an appointment
it was then according to the information that we received from the
african national congress that they last heard of him no trace
whatsoever was could be made no sign of his remains or where an action
could have taken place and his life perhaps lost
	so now mr zuma and the other people later i mean further informed us
that they were busy with the investigation because they said joy hayden
according to them was a plant of the regime who had penetrated the
movement and it was later on that they discovered that she was actually a
plant and not a part of the liberation movement so their suspicion was
that she could provide further information as to his disappearance but
it is now very clear that he is no longer there because i tend to
imagine that a person who was a commander in the mk unit of the transvaal
couldn’t really up to now not be traced so we are we strongly accept i
mean suspect and we have come to accept that he is no more
	at this very same meeting an arrangement had to be made we with us as a
family and the delegation of the african national congress that
according to african tradition when somebody is dead obviously there
should be some ritual of some sort to an extent that it was mutually
agreed that we have i think it was on the nd of february that we
agreed to have a sort of a memorial service so that so that this could
become a finished business on our part because it had become very clear
that he was no more so together with the african national congress
such a memorial service was held at home where there was also an
undertaking on the part of the african national congress through mr john
nkadimeng and edgar mushwana that further investigations will be made and
we would as a family be kept informed but we tended to understand that
since it was still a liberation movement no elections had as yet been
conducted it was very difficult for them as a liberation movement to
	then after the elections we tended to take up the matter again we
sent quite a good number of submissions by fax to shell house and even
to the premier’s office at pietersberg to try and follow up the matter
like i said before that it should really become a finished business on
our part that his remains be brought home so that at least when we see
where his remains are buried then it will be something that we we as a
family should would ultimately accept that well it is just that
that that we asked for an appointment with premier of the northern
transvaal northern province that we ultimately get to some agreement as
to where the matter now stood it was just unfortunate that an
appointment was made and when we went there we couldn’t just find the
premier in several attempts were made to contact the premier’s office
to contact the regional office at pietersberg where very little i’m
afraid to say really turned up until we decided to contact to use the
facilities and structures provided by the trc here where we contacted
members of i mean their representative or field workers to try and take
up the matter that well arrangements were made statements men were
people were sent to us to have the statement taken which we did and
ultimately we find ourselves today here
	but our main submission to the honourable commission is this that
further investigation be made because we have really as a family like
like i’ve said before i’ve accepted that our brother is no more and that
further and final investigations be made and that his remains at least
be brought home for us so that it becomes a finished business
	i should make a further submission here that that’s why you don’t see
my mother with us here she’s now over eighty and she hasn’t as yet do
not taken to accept it you know as a fact that we feel the trc here
should on our part we regard it as a vehicle which will definitely help
us in taking this matter to it’s ultimate conclusion
	may i further submit that my younger brother left two young children and
my mother and i have to act as guardians to these children and it’s such
an awesome business especially if you imagine what sacrifice he has made
in the course of the struggle that i think this is something that the
commission has to consider very very seriously
	so we were further relieved when we got a copy of the anc’s submission
to the truth commission by the deputy president thabo mbeki whereby an
indication whereby they made a submission as to his disappearance and
apparently later on i discovered that this doesn’t really differ much
from what we got at shell house so our submission to the honourable
commission is that this matter be thoroughly investigated and what we’d
really like to see as a family is his remains and i think it is then and
then only that we as a family could then consider the question of
reconciliation is then and then only that we could consider the question
of forgiveness how do forgive a person that you haven’t seen how do you
forgive a person who has committed such an act we know it was a south
africa was in a state of war perhaps he was killed in action if ever
that’s the case let’s hear of it and if ever this joy hayden killed our
brother by infiltrating into the struggle let her tell us why she had to
kill him where she killed him and how she killed him that ultimately we
get we be given his remains and they be given a decent funeral that is
our submission to the honourable commission as a family thank you
thank you very much mr mthebule for that clear account and
submission that your family has presented through you and i know that
even though you’ve gone through that memorial service it’s very difficult
to accept the fact that your is is dead and even if you do accept you
would like some tangible results and i think here at least there are
some leads which the trc could follow because you mention a joy hayden
and in your statement you also say this was revealed by olivia forsyth
could you give us some idea who this olivia forsyth is 
thank you i am afraid that i have no idea of this olivia
forsyth accept that my suspicion is that let alone by getting a
statement from me one other statement was given by my younger sister out
in johannesburg so apparently that one she is the one who has given the
commission that name because the statement was taken from her because
it was her who was staying with him while he was still underground
you also state that there are two children who were left by
and you and your mom have been looking after these children
i just want to find out what did the anc ever do in relation to these
not for now but what i can state before this commission is
that while he was supposedly still in exile before the unbanning of the
liberation movements my mother used to get some financial support from
individuals who were operating apparently from holland and but later on
when things became clear these individuals told us that they were acting
as a front for the african national congress they were used as a front
in fear detection the ones i must say really submit some assistance
until i think but up to now there’s there has been nothing
i’ve no further questions mr mthebule accept that with all
the information that we have here and the contacts that we have with the
anc since they did make their submission to the trc maybe we could
refer the matter back to our investigators and hopefully they might come
thank you very much mr mthebule your submission is very clear
that ignatius did go into exile he did join the mk and that he was
probably killed while coming back into the country so i don’t really
think that we need to ask you anymore questions except just to point out
	first is that you may be aware or you probably will be made aware of the
fact that that the that the present government has now adopted and
accepted in parliament a special pension fund for exliberation fighters
mk umkonto wesiswe apla as well as azanla and that this fund this
pension fund it’s now been adopted by parliament money has been voted i
think the the figure that was mentioned was three billion rand and that
this money is available for those who were members of mk and i would
imagine that the survivors the next of kin particularly children and
on on this matter there is a special department in pretoria headed up
by a certain mr wentzel trevor wentzel who’s coordinating this and i
would advise that you that you as a family make contact with that
special department or if you have any difficulties and you want us to
assist in facilitating that we certainly can but it’s been accepted
that there should be a special pension fund for for those who were
members of mk as well as the other liberation movements now with regard
to to your questions or your requests that you have put to us that you
want as a family and we un understand a resolution of this matter
there are two ways really that this matter hopefully can be resolved
	the first is that amnesty applications are still coming in and we hope
that through amnesty applications many of these issues will be resolved
i’m sure that you have you must have seen in the news that not that long
ago some individuals came forward in connection with the disappearance
and they’ve now accepted that they killed him and that they covered up
his death of stanza bopape who was an activist in mamelodi and that was
also a case which had been unresolved for a very long time and through
our investigations and through the amnesty process we’re now able to to
have a better idea of what actually happened so that’s the one avenue
and as i say these applications are still coming in the closing date is
the th of may of this year for people still to apply for amnesty
that’s one of the ways in which we hope many of these issues will be
	the second is the powers which we as a commission have to question
people and in fact even to subpoena people to come before the commission
and answer our questions and you have in your statement there are
certain names which you have mentioned people who who we now know
actually were had infiltrated the anc olivia forsyth is the one name in
your statement and it has been established that she was actually an agent
for the former government that infiltrated the anc and we we will be
following up on these names and on these individuals in trying to get
some answers to to to these questions
	so we appreciate you coming forward and we will really make every effort
to try and find these answers we appreciate the trust and confidence
that you put in the commission but we want to also say that many such
cases are coming before us that we have limited resources we do try to
follow up so we would urge a little bit of patience on the part of your
family i know this has been going on for a long time it’s probably hard
for you to have patience when you’ve been waiting so long but we appeal
to you and as soon as we are able to answer we certainly will thank you
and and your family thank you very much
welcome this is our final day of hearing in the in the
northern province we’ve been to messina to louis trichardt and today
in tzaneen but although this is going to be the last day that we have
human rights violations here in this region we will be announcing
during the course of the day we will be telling you about a followup
meeting which is going to be held in the northern province in pietersberg
on the the third of may but we will give you all the details later the
venue and the time and also explain to you what the purpose of such a
meeting is so welcome and before we actually officially begin i’m going
to ask father patrick galvin if he would please open today’s proceedings
opens proceedings with a prayer and a hymn
we are going to ask you to just please bear with us today this
public hearing covers a very wide area people will be coming from
tzaneen people will be also be coming from phalaborwa from umkonkor
and because of that it’s quite likely that there are going to be some
delays in the arrival of people so please bear with us there are big
distances which people have to travel that is going to mean that we will
have to change the program unfortunately so the program that you have in
front of you for hearings today we will have to change that somewhat
to accommodate people as and when they arrive so we won’t necessarily be
following the order of the program which you have in front of you i also
just want to explain to people about the service which is provided the
interpretation service there are these headsets it’s a box and there
are these earphones and what this enables us to do is to have four
languages interpreted at the same time so you can follow the witnesses
and you can follow the proceedings either in afrikaans if needed which
will be on channel one you’ll see on the side of this box there are
numbers there is a dial and you can either tune in on channel one which
will be afrikaans when needed channel two will be english throughout
the proceedings on channel three you will hear tsonga and on channel
four you will hear northern sotho peddie these headsets are available
from the front here where the these booths are and i would urge those
people who have difficulty following to to get a set and to use that to
follow the proceedings now as i said not all the witnesses have arrived
so we unfortunately going to have to change the program our first
witness today i’ll ask please come forward
we’re going to ask matias nkwamba to come forward please
mr nkwamba good morning mr nkwamba can you hear me
good morning to you and welcome can you please
can you introduce the lady who is with you this morning
i extend a warm welcome to her too mr nkwamba before i ask
you to tell you story will you please stand to take the oath if you
will just repeat after me i swear that the story i’m about to tell is
the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
thank you very much mr nkwamba we are with your story going
back to to a place called lulekane you are going to tell us what
happened to you and to your community in that area we have of course got
your statement but please take your time and tell us what happened in
thank you it was during we were staying in the sotho
homeland at palaborwa magushane mashege masimali namagalin during
that time it was the beginning of the homeland system i left the place
because i was not on good terms with the people in the community it was
during later i reported the matter to the palaborwa magistrate
court and the commissioner gave me the place by the name of farm kwagga
while i was at kwagga many people started arriving stay in my place and
those people used to ask for transport normally this place was donated
by the tsonga speaking people i helped these people by transporting them
from their different areas and take them to farm kwagga because people
started arriving in numbers and i couldn’t afford to help them i
requested the gazankulu government to come and help the government
refused or failed to help they said they were afraid that the government
cars might be destroyed by the lebowa people they promised to pay me in
	in an advisory committee was formed to run the community me
myself personally i was the chairperson of the board however things
didn’t go well because we were not in good terms with the other members
at the very same time we had a problem involving two children who
disappeared their disappearance was so mysterious the station commander
by the name of mr fourie and mr nyati came to me to report the matter i
told them that i’m not going to take the matter because jordaan is the
person who’s responsible and i will take the matter to him i took the
matter to jordaan and he said i must go and inform all the people and i
did inform the people we had a meeting at nkatego high school after we
had the meeting we were told that one old woman took those children but i
think those were all lies and rumours my wife when people started
having gatherings she also went to these meetings to find out exactly
what was being discussed there and i’ll also like you to give her a
chance to give exactly what was happening in those meetings what i did
is that i informed the police because farm kwagga at that time we
didn’t have police a police station in this place the only police
station was in palaborwa and that’s where i reported the matter up to
the tenth of june people came in big numbers to our place and they
started burning my house and my cars and other properties my businesses
my mother died she she wasn’t sick but she was affected by what
happened to me what surprised me is that jordaan sent policemen to guard
my family but they never did help us and they were present while all
these things were happening this is the truth that i’m telling here the
way he there and after the burning of my property i had to take these
policemen and go with them to town while i was at the police station in
town i asked constable mr grobbelaar to call the chief minister of the
homeland gazakulu mr ntsanmisi and i talked to him tried to explain to
him exactly what happened he was also surprised as to how come these
things happened however what surprised me is that while i was in the
police station while talking to mr grobbelaar grobbelaar said to me
chief nkwamba how did these things happen chief tzangwisi said to me
take the phone from the constable and i took the phone from the constable
and he asked me tell me who is this person who’s saying chief nkwamba
there at your side and i said to chief tzangwisi you better ask mr
grobbelaar and i took the phone back to mr grobbelaar tzangwisi asked mr
grobbelaar why are you referring to nkwamba as chief nkwamba grobbelaar
	as all these things happened four young men were arrested and the case
was had at the regional court the magistrate asked me as to whether you
saw the people who burnt your house and i told the magistrate that i
didn’t see the person that burnt the house but there were many people and
the magistrate said to me those young men who were here we are trying
them because they killed someone by the name of olossi kumalo they
killed this person inside his house and the person was burnt right inside
the house and they said that your case you’ll have to be compensated
this was said by the regional magistrate mr coetzee those who were
arrested those young men something surprised me they were given bail
by the state to be out of prison they were sentenced eight years and out
of eight years the case was taken over by the state and the matter was
decided and they have to spend four years in jail this worried me a lot
and i couldn’t understand as to how the government have intervened in
	after up to a stage where a newspaper was published which said this
newspaper report stated that i am a mozambiquan citizen and i also came
from mozambique this is the newspaper document he said i am from
mozambique because this troubled him in his mind the cause of his
trouble is that when i got farm kwagga people of farm kwagga wanted me to
be their chief and this worried the chief minister and this led to him
publishing this document and i’ll be very pleased if the chairperson of
this committee might like to see what’s written in this document and this
	what also worried me a lot is that the old regime apartheid
parliament when the chief minister wanted to become a chief he should
not have destroyed my life the whole parliament should have asked me and
sit with them around the table to discuss the matter so that there might
not be any violence or confusion they’re supposed to have heard this
side of my story they didn’t do that they went underground and
destroyed my things this had worried me a lot the parliament didn’t
have any opposition they had to take whatever the chief minister was
saying in other ways i can say if the house didn’t have any power to
oppose that means that one person had to rule and he destroy whatever
	after all this they sent mr matchimane mr langa and magistrate chahoke
to go and collect me they said i must be brought alive to parliament
when they arrived i said to ask them what are you coming here for
they said the honourable minister have sent me to come to and fetch you
to go and talk to him and i told them that i don’t have any problem with
him if i have any problem it’s me between me and god because i’ve done
all my work i managed to fight for the rights of the people and i took
them from the other lands and bring them to one place i managed to talk
to them i didn’t do anything wrong to them and i haven’t they haven’t
done anything bad to me and he’s the one who’s troubling me in my life
mr chairman i would like to ask you to take this into your hearts and
understand that this is painful i would like again to ask you mr
chairman my house has been burnt down
mr nkwamba i’m going to sir can you listed to me
i can hear you the honourable chairperson
we will take whatever documentation you have afterwards i
would just like to ask you some questions please
mr nkwamba i want to just go back to a time before you were
moved to lulekane you said you were living in an area of lebowa and you
had businesses there already but then you started encountering problems
with peddiespeaking people who were saying that they were not happy with
you as a tsongaspeaking person now i just want to go back and
understand that a little did that arise suddenly or did that happen over
a period of time i’m asking this because yesterday when we were in louis
trichardt we heard about the community of vleifontein that also had all
these groups of people living together and as the homelands structures
were created people were then pocketed into their own homelands was it
as a result of that that this division arose or were there other reasons
my answer is this when the homelands started that’s where
apartheid intensified i personally was given businesses and even other
women many women they had businesses where they have to sell vegetables
and they had licence and i also had licences for my businesses these
women police from the lebowa government took all the licences of these
women i personally went to consult mr conrad concerning this matter at
the time of commissioner mr jansen who is now at orange free state we
tried to sit down and solve the matter i also had licence at namagale
but because of this homeland apartheid issue we were told that we have
to move and forget our businesses thank you mr chairperson
thank you sir i just want to follow that up with a few
other questions you say in your statement again that you had applied to
be the chief of this area to the central pretoria government and then
subsequently chief minister etswanisi came and installed himself as the
chief was that again a common thing that happened in this area where
suddenly a minister of government comes and declares himself the chief of
this was a surprise to me and also to the community when a
person come and impose himself as a chief and not being elected to be a
chief by the people a person just like a company like a very big tree
which is so big and all of you are afraid of the tree that was the kind
of situation at that time when there was an application to put me into
the house as a chief i’m very much proud of that because i think i
deserved that i worked a lot within the community because i think to
help the people was a talent given to me by god and i believe that and
individual’s talent belongs to that particular individual that was given
by the god and even the bible say so
you have said in your statement that people resisted the
installation of of the chief minister as as a chief of your area what
resistance was shown and and how did it show it’s how did it manifest
thank you mr chairperson on the rd of march they
called a meeting for all the chiefs of gazakulu at a shopping centre and
he told them is this bull of the nation still roaring some said yes
he’s still roaring and others we asked them if he’s still roaring what
shall we do they said we have to cut his horns and i asked if a cow
without horns can kill he said yes they said yes and they said what
do you have to do with it and i said we should kill that cow that was
the answer truly i think that day on the rd of march police
and camouflage soldiers came to my house they stayed for a long time
outside the gate i could remember one of them he was a short policeman
and he asked why are you stopping us at the gate and not allowing us in
do you know why we’re here why are you so afraid and then later they
entered the house in my house we had a church and they went into the
church temple they went there there was a tap and they said they must
close the tap because we don’t want this person around here and you
mustn’t do anything and the people said we didn’t come here to close the
tap why did you bring us to this place you said if a cow without horns
can kill another one which has horns then show us that person whom
should be killed and he said no leave that and he fall down on his knees
before the temple and they had to carry him out and they left the place
you can i just take you back to and the disappearance
of these youths that you’re talking about in your statement what was
the the background to these disappearances and how does that relate to
what you’ve been telling us already and how many youths disappeared
mr chairperson i will say it was not young men who
disappeared they were children i don’t personally know the children
they were children from the dimbane family after the children
disappeared dimbane went to police station to meet the station commander
mr fourie and mr nyati they gave a statement to these policemen
according to what i’ve heard these were two children a boy and a girl
fourie and nyati came to me as a leader in that community to give me this
or to tell me about this matter i didn’t want to get deep into the
matter and i told them that i’m under a magistrate therefore i have to
take the matter to the magistrate mr jordaan mr jordaan came
immediately and i gave the matter to him and he wrote me letter telling
me that you have to gather the people and tell them about this story
and i had asked people to a meeting and tell them about the problem about
the disappearance of these two children because we were told that these
two children disappeared within the family of mrs mkasi whose house was
burned and i think all these things were rumours when we started
investigating the matter at the meeting we ask how did you know that
how did you came to find out that these people were taken by mrs mkasi
the people said we went to a witch a sangoma and this sangoma came
cooked some muti and give to the people to get drunk and these people can
see some visions or a bioscope to call it and these people got the
vision that people were taken these children were taken by mrs mkasi
this was not true because they were given muti which get them drunk and
they said speaking nothings which didn’t mean anything this is what i
thank you the last question again from your statement you
said that when your property was burning and this was being done by
community members the police stood by at a distance and watched now by
this do you mean that the police were unable to control the crowds or
were the police supportive of the whole situation
thank you mr chairperson you are eloquent and you can i
hope that whatever i explain will give you a clear picture as to what
happened the police were capable of doing their job however if i have
to get to the understand my understanding of the matter is that after
i’ve spoken to mr grobbelaar and talked to the chief minister and the
chief minister complained that i was referred to as a chief minister
that’s were i have to go back the memory lane and think that’s where the
conflict started it’s not the police who were unable to protect my
property they didn’t fail and they were really capable the problem i
think started where i was referred to as a chief and the chief minister
was angry about it from there i think that’s where the whole matter
mr nkwamba are you still living in in this farm kwagga or
where i stay the place is called farm kwagga which is known
as lulekane today lulekane is the name of a person i would say like
zamusi himself zamusi is not his surname his surname if maleleke and
when he gave the name lulekane to this place he was trying to give this
place the name of his surname as it’s name when i arrived to the kwam
kwagga we wanted to call it mala mala and chief minister changed it to
lulekane i’m still staying there right today today i’m not the
chief however the people they still come and insist that they’re not
going to accept anyone as a chief the only person that they want it’s
me even if the people other people have to stone zamusisan as a chief
people insist that i have to work for the community to do all the things
that affects their life however it’s so difficult for me to have to
help them however it’s not my request however people cars still come
to me to ask for help i still even have the documents of people thank
mr nkwamba did i hear you well that you did apply to the
that’s is the truth as i said each and every individual has
his or her own talent i deserved to be there is no one who will go to
work for the whole month to work and only at the end of the month to
get his reward being paid to someone else i think i’ve worked for the
community and i deserved to be a chief before the chief minister died i
wrote a letter which i took it to his office to show him and i i wanted
to make it clear to him what kind of a person is there a person who
can work without a reward even him to say the truth he wasn’t a chief
he was a lecturer at the university of the north allow me that mr
chairperson he wasn’t a chief but they asked him to come and stand as a
chief minister to run the country or the homeland i will say i did work
hard for the community therefore i have to say it and i think there is
not any other reward which could be given to me and i have to get myself
as you put it that you did a lot for the people i guess you
could have put up schools you could have put up clinics but one area
that is still a problem is the one that you referred to of witchcraft
where you are saying two children were assumed to have been burnt down in
a house how did you handle that problem
thank you mr chairperson that is true in connection with
schools or clinics when i arrived at kwagga farm it was just a forest
there wasn’t even water there was nothing the commissioner said there’s
nothing we can do about water and other things i had to work for the
community go buying pipes and install pipe water pipes and i built a
school in that forest i have to take children to school i have to take
their parents to your work to palaborwa fosco and many other places and
if i come back to the issue of the children who disappeared
i just wanted to hear your response to the question the
rest we quite appreciate you know how much you did for the people
mr chairperson can you please repeat your question
you spoke about two kids i don’t know if it’s pauline or
enyati or not who got burnt who have said to have been burnt down in a
house and that setup you explained in a manner which suggested you know
some mystics which it’s just not too clear where you’re involved
witchcraft and so on so my question was what did you do with the
problem of witchcraft in that community
firstly mr chairperson i would like to say children were
not burnt d i hope you understand that mr chairpen no children were
burnt the people said this old lady mrs ngasi has stolen these
children and hidden them inside the house mason dimbane’s wife was when
they got married she already had the two children and they had to get
married and stayed with the children together if i get it clearly i
didn’t see but i heard that the children were taken by their former or
their real parent or father away what was burnt was mrs ngasi’s house
and property and not the children and the reason why it was burning was
because they thought she took the children the children were not burnt
they were taken by the real father and they to be hidden somewhere i
will say this was the beginning of the politics issue where people
	when it comes to witchcraft i personally didn’t have the right to
interfere in work within this field of witchcraft because the police
were the bright people who were dealing with that matter mr chairperson
that’s the reason why i had to go and report the matter to the police
because i didn’t want to be involved in witchcraft issues and the police
as the people who had to maintain law and order they have to go and
investigate and prevent such issues thank you
to understand you clearly mr nkwamba are we saying that the
problems largely between you and etzwanise and not between you and the
central government that is not between you and the apartheid government
thank you mr chairperson i didn’t have any conflict or
problem with the national government national party government i had a
problem with the chief minister mr etzwanise he was my friend he was a
very good friend to me however the friendship ended when the farm
kwagga came into this into between us
thank you sir thank you for coming to to speak to us what is
becoming more and more clear to us in the in the commission as we work
especially in these areas where there was so many different homeland
structures is the way in which these homeland structures upset and
interfered with the traditional structures and with the traditional
chieftanships one of the jobs that we actually have is to try and and
understand this and present a picture of of what was actually happening
we are quite fortunate in that we in in the audience today we
actually have some of the members of government who are advisors to the
premier on some of these traditional matters this is mr tjolo here and
we also have mr shope who advised the premier on these issues and we will
certainly try and contribute to that process in form of recommendations
and in the form of also trying to bring to the attention of the of the
governments the provincial governments in particular but national the
national government in general what we have learnt our understanding
and suggest maybe some recommendations as to how’s these issues can be
tackled and and hopefully some solutions can be found because we we
we see in we see more and more just how these homeland structures
divided people and and and how often it led to people losing their
homes people losing livestock people losing businesses and people being
impoverished so thank you very much for your for your account it
certainly helps us to understand and will help us in our work and as dr
randera said if you have any other documentation which you want to make
available to the commission please do so either through zodwa who’s next
to you or through any other member of staff of the commission thank you
we’re ready to call our next witness thank you
our next witness is nakedi elton ramalepe

together with ngoako ramalepe who whom i’m here for
i welcome him too can you please stand to take the oath if

good morning you are here to tell us about your brother who
yes he’s my older brother could you please continue and
tell us what happened what do you know about him
ngoako ramalepe was an src president at motcheche college of
education in one day in the area of gabane where there was a youth
march organized by the youth in gabane at the end of the march during
that day the policemen appeared and they came to approach the people who
were marching they dispersed those people that day during that time
when the people were dispersing that was when ngoako and his friend
robert decided to go to to the shop to get some bread on their way they
were surprised why the the police were confronting them and as they were
just frightened the police grabbed them they arrested them and took
them to their to gabane police station but those were the leboa police
as i’ve already explained that this is the friend robert who was with
him or the person who used to work with the late ngoako i’ll ask the
chairperson to give robert who’s the one who has first first hand
information to at least tell something to the to the commission about how
did robert give the statement to the commission
excuse me could you please repeat your question sir
i was asking you if robert has given has already given the
statement to the truth and reconciliation commission
i don’t know if he had given the statement already
yes i did give the statement sir

you to take the oath but if we can just stick to the to what we’ve gone
come to talk to today all right if you can just stand to take the
oath just repeat after me i swear that the story i’m about to tell is
the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me god
could you please continue robert and say what you know about
when we were at gabane shopping centre they took us to the
police station when we got to the police station they ask they didn’t
ask us a thing they started beating us up with everything they beat us
with sjamboks with the bags of the rifles they were kicking us until i
lost consciousness when i woke up i realized that we were in the bush
they dumped us there and i realized that ngoako was with me there as
ngoako was my senior or he was older than me i could not pick him up i
just ran away and went back to the township in gabane location when i
got there i explained to the students what happened to us and they
decided to go to the hospital to look for ngoako and they found that
ngoako was there at the the hospital mortuary and he was dead and mr
ramusi came to us the next day he fetched me and he took me to his
offices to get a statement from me from there i ran away and i went to
as you’re explaining to us robert when you regained
consciousness didn’t you run to the police station
no i did not because i was afraid of the police because
they’re the ones who beat us up
and you nakedi did you go to the police station to report
as this was the students issue and they had their own
lawyer we found out that they were the ones who were handling the issue
and they they had already taken it to the lawyers
didn’t did they come back to you and report to you what
further steps did they take besides taking the matter to their lawyers
what we knew as a family is that this this was taken to
court and there was a trial in in several times
during the trial who were called who were accused of the
as i i was explaining i’m i was dizzy most of the times
and i’m only the young the young brother to my brother i would like you
to ask many questions to robert
the people who were accused were they leboa policemen
their station commander was one of them mr ramulta who was
the one who gave orders to the police to fetch us from the police from
it was the policemen and that was the only thing that i knew
was that the only thing that that you had nakedi
yes as a family the report that we got was that the
policemen were accused they were found guilty but we didn’t know whether
they they were sentenced or not and we didn’t know what type of sentence
robert and ngoako were you the leaders of the students at
yes ngoako was the president and i was the secretary to the
what were your complaints at the time was it political
firstly we wanted to form the src that’s where the problem
started after forming the src the other schools in our area also wanted
to form the src that’s where we were starting our dressings other
what were you going to do with the src’s
the src was was the organization to represent the students
i believe that when you were starting the src’s it was
because you had many problems and complaints that’s why i’m asking you
that the src’s what problems were were were you addressing
it was the complaints coming from the students and we were
don’t you have some problems that you can give us as an
they used to complain about sexual harassment between
lecturers and students again they we were not allowed to go outside the
school gate and it was it to it was only for thirty days and the boys
were only allowed on wednesdays and thursdays and we were unhappy about
if i understood you well this thing does not have any
political mo motive behind it it was just student politics actually
in the college that’s where the students started standing up
and then we formed a branch of the udf after the src was formed that
that was the one which was involved in politics
if i understood you well when the police came to the
college and started fighting with you did they get any permission from
when the police they found that in in the shopping centre in
gampane not at school they took us from the shopping centre and they
took us to the police station to the police station
when they found you in the shopping centre were you not
there was a march in the township
there were other comrades who were arrested in the in the
township so they were released and people were happy for their release
so it was a march of celebrating their release
thank you thank you robert for coming forward to speak about
this incident as you said in your testimony there was an inquest
there’s always supposed to be police inquest when a when a death is not
from natural causes when it’s unnatural and that there were people who
were implicated and who were charged and that there there was a case
throughout the the the cause of the work of the commission one of the
things that has always been said by victims and this is something which
the commission also agrees with is they say that if this process of
reconciliation is to mean anything then it’s not only for those who have
been victimized not only for those who suffered gross human rights
violations to come forward or for their families to come forward but for
those who committed violations the perpetrators the victimizers to
also come forward so that this process can be a complete process and that
provision is made for perpetrators to the amnesty committee that the
whole purpose of the commission is not vengeance it’s not a witch hunt
notwithstanding what people have said it’s really an attempt to try to
deal with the conflicts of the past to understand those conflicts and in
that spirit to move forward so the appeal that we constantly make is
that those that have been implicated in gross human rights violations
those who know that they have been involved that this is an opportunity
for you to come forward through the amnesty process to explain your part
and your role so that the survivors be they the family members or the or
the direct victims themselves can start putting these events in in the
	your brother was we know was an important activist in his area that
he was centrally involved in the whole fight to establish src’s student
representative councils against prefix systems which were seen as
extensions of authoritarian structures and src’s were seen as more
representative and more democratic he was also involved in the initial
steps to set up the united democratic front and those were some of the
reasons why he did become a target those are things which we have been
able to establish so again our appeal is to those who who know what
they did to come forward and to use the amnesty process so that the
victims can also have some satisfaction and can move on so thank you
very much for coming to to speak to us
our next witness is samson tibane mr tibane good afternoon
could you stand to take the oath
mr tibane my name is doctor randera i’m going to help you
as you tell your story you are taking us back to to tzaneen itself
and you’re going to tell us about the shooting and subsequent death of
your son wilson tibane can you take your time and tell us your story
thank you very much in the year that’s when people
started discussing fighting for their country on that particular day
when they started making a slogan these children they went to a very
clear ground which was called dan they had left they’d marched towards
dan to go and discuss issues about the new government that they wanted a
new government my child was one of this group of children who were
making the slogan towards dan when they started talking i as a parent
was at work when i came back from work that day i was working on a
night shift i was the watchman of one of the companies when they
marched to dan just as they were approaching this area they had not
completely approached the area where they were going to discuss the
issues that’s when they were going to discuss that they wanted a new
	so there were a lot of police of gazankulu that appeared they had not
yet started discussing what they had wanted to do issues that would
assist them in in that year in this period that we’re on the police
approached and there were lots of them the police just started shooting
because there were lots of these children there were their leaders and
all other people who were there when the police started shooting one of
the bullets hit my child and he fell when he fell he could still speak
there was nobody we were not there we were not there among them while
they wanted to discuss issues about the new government and once he was
shot by these police it took quite a long time before they took him to
	at home there’s a man from magwalane who was a detective he came to my
home and he found my wife and he knocked hard at my place and my wife
came out and he said hey there’s a child there who’s there but when we
asked him he said he’s a tibane child because i realized that i knew
the father is my priest i’ve run to come and inform you here and then
they ran together and went to another man a fellow church man who has a
car this man has since passed away who’s juster machebe he’s the one
who came to fetch me at work and said things are very bad at home the
police have really damaged things they’ve killed your son
	and i couldn’t walk as you can see even now i’m not able to walk
properly but they took me to the hospital and i asked my child what had
happened my son he said the police has shot me and the police were
there and say why do you leave your children to go to these meetings
but just look now you’ve lost your child now i said to this policeman
that is good you’ve done what you wanted to do god will see you
	the following day because the police had taken this child to the
hospital the following day when i knocked off from work i went home the
hospital people came to ask me to sign something because apparently the
bullet had lodged itself inside they asked me to come and sign and they
took him to garamkwa hospital but he didn’t arrive he didn’t reach
garamkwa hospital he had died along the way so they came back to me to
explain to me that my child had died but that wasn’t the end of matters
	when i hear from other people who were with him that they were arrested
they were arrested and and tortured quite a lot that they were
assaulted i even heard that they went to court but because i was so
disturbed and i wasupset i had thought that they should have shot me so
it’s lucky that i wasn’t shot at that stage but i feel i should have been
killed together with my son i should have been shot so they went to
court with some lawyers but and the police were found guilty but i don’t
know what happened thereafter but things matters didn’t end there and
eventually i buried my child but this thing disturbed me very deeply
	when we came back from the funeral there were lots of people when we
went to the funeral the police people were there hiding ambushing
wanting to ambush us after the funeral they followed us just before we
arrived at unxoxoa they started shooting again they shot people with
teargas and rubber bullets so at home people didn’t arrive when what
really worries me a lot i’d made a lot of food for the audience the cow
that had been slaughtered for the family that had come to join the
funeral brought it there was people who couldn’t come to eat at home
mr tibane i have only one question to ask from what you have
said already your son was very heavily involved in the political
situation in this part of the country influenced by the launch of the
i understand the udf was to be launched here in can you
just tell us how old your son was was he still a student at the time 
he was sixteen years old and he was still at school
how many children are you left with mr tibane 
i only have five children those are the surviving children
tate tibane you say that the police disrupted the funeral
had they told you how many people should be at the funeral or you were
just allowed all to go to the funeral 
there were a lot of people a lot of people went to the
cemetery but they went to the police went to hide themselves somewhere
as we were coming back from the funeral that’s when they disrupted the
crowd and said they shouldn’t come to my house
oh so there were no restrictions as to the number of people
who should attend the funeral i’m trying to ask this because i want to
there were restrictions so there were only family members who
came a lot of people who had wanted to come were prevented from coming
because there were road blocks by the previous government
mr tibane did you take the matter up with the police 
no i didn’t pursue things further with the police because
the very place where i would pursue this matter with the police are the
no there was no investigation but the police came to me to
get a statement because i couldn’t even walk even if i wanted to make any
efforts to pursue this matter i couldn’t walk
had you instructed any lawyer to act on behalf of the family
no i couldn’t do that because i couldn’t walk even now i’ve
mr tibane this is one of those cases that have repeated
themselves so often in the history of our country where people are shot
and killed at demonstrations and particularly where people were
demonstrating against structures the governments which were imposed upon
them homeland governments or community councils and the police and the
army would often come in and there would be a confrontation and there
would be live ammunition and your son is one of those tragic victims
	in the statement that you gave to us you did indicate that the people
who were on the scene that day were part of the south african police
they have been informed we have written to them we have sent them a
copy of the statement we have asked them to comment and to give us
information on which unit of the police force was present at that date
we’re still waiting for a response from them but we will certainly let
you know as soon as we hear from them
	i see in your statement also you do say that for the families the
survivors and what is very important is to recognise the victims those
who lost their lives by the erection of tombstones by the building of
schools by the erection of monuments and these are things which the
reparations and rehabilitation committee are taking very very seriously
and will certainly i’m sure form part of their policies and their
recommendations which they make to the president at the end of the life
	and we certainly hope and believe that people like you son people like
wilson who was killed in the prime of his life sixteen years old will
be some of those who will benefit from this kind of recognition of the
	thank you very much for coming to us and sharing what is obviously still
something very painful thank you again	
has clearly been someone who’s believed strongly in your
principles and you carried those principles out in the community that you
lived in i just want to make one point in relationship to your story and
so many other stories that we’ve heard today many people say that the
truth commission is about the past and closing the past but the truth
commission is also a mirror on the future and your story as well as the
others today reflects one of those mirrors if you like because it
clearly shows that where people who are meant to protect our rights and
the rights and and the people i’m talking about here are the police
where they start taking sides in a situation and start believing clearly
that one side is better than another side then they stop protecting our
rights and in a sense i think that’s what we need to also be learning as
we’re going along that that’s part of the recommendations if you like
that the truth commission will be making
	i really thank you very very very much for being so patient today and
coming here and sharing your story with us thank you ladies and
brings to an end the proceeding here today in zeerust we have heard
many many stories today i want to finish where i started off this
morning which is to appeal again to people to come forward on the one
side to make your statements if you haven’t been able if you haven’t
been covered today as far as statements go there will be people coming
	on the other side and i think as we’ve heard the stories today people
have been very careful when it’s when it’s come to mention the names of
the individuals who were responsible for that pain and torture but as i
think it was dr ally who said earlier on that we have informed those
people those people should have received letters not should will have
received letters from us as well as a statement that has been made by
the individuals who have come forward today
	that time that’s been offered to us that we as a nation and as a
government have allowed to happen so that people can come forward and
tell their side of the story is now we have four days left before the
amnesty deadline closes and i think this is the opportunity for people
those people to come forward and to apply for amnesty if they so wish
or to respond to us and to the letters that we’ve sent to them so

it was on thursday at night around o’clock somebody came
and wake us up saying people are crowded at the shop and they were
singing anc slogans and they are looting at the restaurant and the
restaurant is burning that’s why father walk up to that place when he
arrived there he saw many people therefore you couldn’t do anything he
turned back and went to the police next to the botswana border he came
	when they arrived there the shop was gutted then they went home whilst
those people are still there they came home they found the police there
and then the police shot them and they ran away then the police were
coming in many instances and protecting they would come for thirty
minutes and leave after four days it was during the day and my parents
were sitting under the tree i was sleeping at that time i could hear a
sound but i thought i was dreaming then i slept again then i could hear
stone throwing my parents ran away and went into the house and outside
were full of people holding anc flags and placards and throwing stones
inside the house and the house was burning we were sitting inside the
house not knowing what to do the house was burning the floor was
burning the ceiling was burning and the ceiling was falling on the
ground we would run to the rooms where there is no fire and later the
whole house was gutted to the ground not knowing what to do we ran
outside the house and they were throwing still throwing stones a
certain boy came to help me a certain one came with a spear then he
tried to stab me but the boy who helped me protected me i was hit with
stones and some of my teeth were removed my two siblings were able to
	in the house was my father and my uncle and inside they were burnt by
that fire then they ran out then my father wanted to jump the fence a
certain boy came with a spade and slapped him and then he fell on the
ground he was pulled outside but my uncle was able to run for a
distance after that he was caught and there was a container of diesel
they were put just next to that container and they were slapped with
those spades they took tyres which were outside and put them on their
	after that the police came after three hours they were taken and all of
us together with my with my brother we were taken to the hospital
they took my father and my uncle to the mortuary the police came after
two weeks to take the statement from there we submitted our statement
then we went to court but we were not informed to come to court but i
went to the police station to ask them why did they take statements and
they don’t want us to come to court but the police said they were afraid
of the confusion because those people would come so they were waiting
for come the court case proceeded those people who were arrested were
given bail because we gave them names of people who were leaders even
up today we didn’t go the court case didn’t proceed even when even
today they still say they are still investigating about those people
lilian just to get something straight your father was not the
only one that was killed in this incident your uncle was also killed
j kadi what was his name the name of your uncle 
the one who died his name is justice kadi
and he was your father’s brother and this 
has anybody besides you made at statement about your late uncle
mr justice kadi other family members 
that’s myself only and my brother
you also mention your a brother and what happened to him he
was eight years old at the time your younger brother
he was eight years at that time
and what did happen to him because you put him down as as 
he lost some teeth because we were hit with stones and we had
both me and him we had just injuries
and another sister a younger sister as well 
now can you tell us a little bit about your father the late
bennet kadi because you speak in your statement about his political
activities maybe you can just tell us a little bit more 
i only know that my father was a member of parliament and that’s
nothing more i know about his political activity
he was a member of parliament in mangope’s government chief
and you don’t know for how long or when he became a member of
parliament you don’t know do you know any of those details 
he started to be a member of parliament in the inception of the
was he just a member of parliament or did he have do you know
if he if he was ever in the cabinet or did he have any other senior
he was just and honorary member of parliament
and your father was also a businessman not so 
there’s conflict because you say that the people who came to
your house on that particular day that they were that you said that
were shouting anc slogans did you say that
and did they have any anc tshirts or flags or anything or was
it just that they were shouting anc slogans 
they were having anc placards and anc flags
these slogans can you remember can you tell us give us an
example of one of the slogans which was shouted 
no i cannot give you an example
now before this this incident where your house was attacked
and burnt were there any other clashes between your father and members of
the village people who you say who you think belonged to the anc 
there was no conflict between my father and the local residents
but some members of the anc yes
now can you tell us about this give us examples of this 
they to our house you know passing and then they would shout
and say he has built a big house with the government’s money and that
they’re going to use that house to be an anc office
and your father did he ever speak about what was happening 
did he ever speak to you about what was happening 
no he was not communicating with us about that in that regard
and your mother at the time where was she 
do you mean the time when they were burnt 
that you’re speaking about where was your mother 
no he was not communicating with us in that regard sir
but you say that the funeral that you organised was very
difficult because you said you were that you were threatened all the
time can you tell us a bit about that about the actual funeral of your
father where it took place and how it was organised 
there were no people who were coming to assist us with the
preparations i was the only one who was running around looking for
money looking for caskets looking for beasts and looking for groceries
and that those people who would come to the funeral would have something
to eat but there was nobody who was helping me even about the
you also say that you were harassed and that you were threatened
during the time that you were trying to organise the funeral can you
they were telling us after we have buried the corpses they would
exhume it and put it in front of our house
you say you did all of this on your own you don’t mention your
mother at all in in your statement can you can you tell tape
my mother is staying at vet luigat and i’m staying with my two
siblings at locally here and they are schooling at mmabatho
these people who you mentioned as the people responsible at
least the people who were part of that group do you ever do you see
them do you interact with them 
i don’t go to that luigat which means i’ve no way of meeting with
them so i haven’t met them since
since that incident since that night of you’ve never had
no i didn’t even meet one of them
thank you very much for coming to speak to us about something
that is obviously very very painful to lose a parent is hard enough but
to lose a parent under those circumstances with the horrific burning that
you that you describe and to witness something like that so thank you
thank you very much for coming to speak to us i’ll give you back to the
you say your mother is staying at vet luigat 
yes we did rebuild the house
so you’re still you’re still in the same house 
yes we’re still in the same house
was it gutted to the ground
yes it was burnt to the ground
so you started from the foundation
i’m working at standard bank in lefurutsi
your siblings what standard are they doing 
two of them are not attending school one is doing standard ten
the other one standard nine the other one standard six
miss lilian thank you for coming and it must have been
very difficult to tell your story i’ll be very brief with my questions
the one question is after the horrible thing that happened to your
family did you or your younger brother and sister or your mother
underwent any form of counselling did people treat you psychologically
no we didn’t we didn’t meet the psychologist sir
would you like that is that a need in the family
definitely i say it is a need
thank you i also see in your statement that you feel that
there’s no tombstone on your father’s grave is that correct 
and then there’s also the matter of the insurance policies
that have not been paid out and you need help with that
thank you there’s a last thing that i would just like to
mention you say in your statement that you are prepared to meet with the
perpetrators of this deed it they are willing to meet with you and
explain what happened is that still the case are you still willing to
yes i’m prepared to meet with them
lilian just one question i heard you say that you’ve out
of the village but your mother still lives in the village now you said
to professor meiring that you’d be willing to meet up with the
after all these years how do you actually feel about what
they destopped our lives because we could have gone to school
now we don’t have somebody responsible who can help us further our
studies i was i couldn’t have been working i could have been at school
thank you lilian lilian i’m sure it’s coming here and
telling your story today is extremely painful this happened four or
five years ago and i just want to echo what dr ally said that this was a
horrific killing almost at the time that we were about to move into a
democratic south africa as you’ve said in your statement yourself i hope
that coming here today has helped in some way and that the questions
that professor meiring has asked you that some help will be provided
thank you very much for coming
mr piet lamola mr lamola good afternoon

your story i would just like professor meiring to help you take the
oath if you’ll just stand please

air please repeat after me what i say is the truth nothing but the
whole truth nothing but the truth so help me god
thank you very much please sit down
good afternoon mr lamola we will ask you that on the th
of january what happened to you explain to us in detail saying
in on the th of january whilst i was still at my place
and i was just about to go out i locked my house because there was
nobody in the house my wife was not present and my children were not
present after i locked i saw a little child next to me next to my
house his mother was not present and there was nobody at his house
after i dislodged the key from the door that child came to me when that
child arrived he came to me and said people there are people who are
having axes they were having pangas with them there were four of them
when they arrived they get hold of me with my jacket they pulled me i
was not able to ask where are you for then they said to me come tell
us what did you do at night i told them that let me place the key where
it’s usually put they say you have no time i just threw it in the
next to the to the house one of them hit me with that panga at the
back they were local people they were not not policemen
	when they have chopped me whilst still holding me with my jacket on
the way they made me to lie down and they kicked me after that they
took me again they took me to mr moilwa and there were tents where
police used to work they put me in those tents they handed me to the
police this children were still holding their pangas the police took me
in their van one of the police said you old man you’re going to tell
the truth he took a teargas canister they closed the tails of the van
after closing those tails then he said he’s going to make it explode
one policeman denied and said don’t do that after some time i was
bleeding by that time there was no one who was giving me something to
wipe off the blood one of them shouted saying one house is burning
it’s then that they pulled me off from the van and put me aside
	then from there they left with their then they went to that house which
was burning after that they brought a woman whose house was burning and
he was shocked also we they put us together they said we which
organisation do we fall do we belong truly i told them that i told
them that i belong to african national congress then they said you know
of what is happening during the night whilst we are asleep they left me
there after some time a certain policeman came but he was wearing
private then he asked those people and say these people that are
bleeding why are you putting them there then one policeman said there
is no car which we can use then that policeman said take them with
	they took me with that police van we went to welgedacht when we
arrived there they took us to the doctor after i was stitched the
police were waiting to fetch to take me to motswedi police station then
they said we are not going to release him he’s going to sleep here
that’s when the police left me there
	on sunday a certain detective came and say are you mr lamola then i
said yes then they said when you are discharged here you must go to
motswedi police station then i i said to him yes i will do so on
tuesday i was discharged then i said if i can go to motswedi i’ll take
myself to the to a lions den i didn’t go there because i knew that
when i go to motswedi i’ll be taking myself to a lions den and the truth
which i will tell them it will not work
	then i ran i went to i flee then i went to zeerust i met with a
group of people who fled from our village i didn’t go back home since
that day since i left on the th i started going home when people were
	i think we went in july when we left zeerust to to our village there
was no case they were innocent during because of the loss of that
government these police did not ask them about the pangas they just
took me and put me in the police van it was those people who went again
to that house which was burning and they burnt that house and accused
that woman that’s how far i can go
you say these boys were four your statements in your
statement you say they were inkatha group were they incatha group in
they were calling themselves inkatha group when they were
assaulting me they were saying they were inkatha group
with whom were they were working for 
they were working for mangope’s government
they were working with the police 
yes they were working with the police
because you said after they you were chopped with pangas
you were taken to the police camp
and again you say it’s molilwa’s mololwa’s yard do you
is this molilwa the the chief which had been imposed by mangope 
yes it was his chief he he put them in in his yard they
pitched their camp in his yard
which means these boys were working for mr molilwa 
yes they were working for him because 
then you said they were asking you about what was happening
at night can you tell us what was happening at night in your village
which they were accusing you of 
when i learnt that night there were houses which were burnt
and there were people who were killed
were they police or these inkatha members 
i don’t know as whether they were killed by inkatha or by the
police because i just heard it was during the day when i heard
you said you are afraid to go to the motswedi police station
therefore you fled where did you go 
we were staying at zeerust in the churches
i was staying at the roman catholic church
you say churches were helping people who were fleeing 
were you staying together in those churches 
yes we were staying in the churches others were staying at
the methodist church others anglican church where there were churches
people were accommodated others were staying with their families
you said you went in july you didn’t tell us you didn’t
tell which year you just said you went you sent back home in july
which year did you go back 
i went the same year in i don’t as whether it’s june or
july but it but it’s the same year
whilst you were staying at the roman catholic church what
i met them at the roman catholic church i met them at these
the major problem in your area was it because of the
conflict between chief molilwa and sebogodi or was it incorporation or
what were what were the reasons
i would not understand because they were saying we should be
incorporated in boputhatswana and some of us we didn’t agree to that
others said we belong to boputhatswana others said we don’t belong to
when you say when you said you were a member of the african
national congress what was anc do to that issue of incorporation 
you said to us you were a member of anc what was anc doing
that anc should not move out of their area 
we whom we call ourselves anc we didn’t want to be
what did you do to show that you didn’t want to go to be
we didn’t want to be incorporated in boputhatswana because we
knew that if we may under boputhatswana they’re going to remove us from
are the police still in molilwa’s yard 
no they are not there i don’t see them anymore
can you identify the police who assaulted you or or the
four boys who have assaulted you are they still there 
yes i know them i can identify
can you identify them do you know their names
i know their names and i can identify them
are they still in your village
yes they’re still in the village
thank you mr lamola i would hand over to the chairperson
 very briefly you’re a pensioner so you don’t
work anymore do you have an income 
i’m on pension i have an income even if it’s too little i’m
not able to support my family with that money because it does me the
pension i got is from railway then every month i get two hundred and
ninety it’s too little to support my family
 is your family your wife and your children how many
and they are all dependent upon you they’re not working 
there are some who are there are those who are working but
they’re working just you know peace jobs or temporary work but others
are attending school and others are not attending school
thank you very much i have no more questions
mr lamola is there anything here else you’d like to say 
mr lamola thank you very much then for coming today we’re
very pleased that you came and told us your story and also to try to help
us understand what happened from what other people have said today
peace has definitely returned to the area which you are living in and the
fact that you say that the four youths who attacked you still live in the
area indicates that some reconciliation has taken place
	we have heard what you have said and your requests to the commission and
we will come back to you thank you very much
come to all the deponents the witnesses who are sitting
here today will be coming to tell us their stories let us just remember
a little about what happened in this particular area of our country
	today of course zeerust is part of the north west province but those
of you who have lived in this area have grown up in this area will
remember that zeerust remained part of if you like white south africa at
the time but not far from here in some of the communities we saw
particularly in the late ’s some of the most intense struggles as
communities refused to be incorporated into the homeland or into the
independent homeland of boputhatswana and many people of course as we
will hear today suffered as a consequence many people died as a
	let us also not forget within the commission were are always being
asked why the truth and reconciliation commission could we not
especially as the amnesty applications have come in and some of those
applicants have been successful at getting their amnesty the question
has often been thrown at us why not go the prosecutory path why not
sentence those people are we not cheapening justice by providing
amnesty but let’s not forget that in not very far from here again
in the then boputhatswana of course people experienced it in a real way
wat we refer to as the right wing elements in our country decided they
would take up arms and support the besieged government of lukas mangope
and that was all around us 	the negotiating process it had started in
kempton park and continued and saw the transitional executive council
come into being there was always that possibility that we all lived with
of of a backlash and i want to say i bring up this point for two
reasons one is just to remind ourselves of that of where we’ve come
from very very recently two also to say to people who have relatives
friends who suffered either torture or death during that uprising they
also have the opportunity to come to the commission because when the
commission came into existence our cutoff date was december we
then appealed to the government and to the president to extend it extend
that period to april of this year and so the uprising in in mafeking in
the then boputhatswana the people actually suffered gross human rights
violations have the opportunity to make statements about what happened
at that time to them or to their family members and please i would like
that message to go through because when we first came into the areas we
were curtailed by the earlier date but that was extended and although
publicity has been given to that on radio television and newspapers my
impression is that sometimes people haven’t got that message clearly
	the last point i want to make is that the amnesty deadline comes to an
end this week although the work of the commission goes on till december
of this year the th of may is on saturday that is going to be the
last opportunity and to quote the archbishop when he appealed to the
nation of sunday a very generous offer has been made by our people and
our government to those individuals from every side who either committed
an act or omission or gross human rights violation for which action can
be legal action can be taken against them in the future that this is
the opportunity the last opportunity the last few days for those people
to come forward and make their amnesty application
	so i appeal again from the commission’s side and there inevitably
today many names will be mentioned of alleged perpetrators now we have
of course as it’s a ruling we have sent off letters to those
individuals but again through today’s hearing i make that appeal once
more sorry i said that was the last point two more points sorry sir
	can i just say that although we are just going to be listening to
twelve people’s stories today that does not mean that all those other
people who made statements to us that their stories are not important
the demanding factor on us and on you is the time factor and we just have
not been able to give everybody the opportunity to come forward and tell
their stories and within the commission we recognise the importance of
that but we also recognise that every statement is important and every
statement is being considered we have almost ten thousand statements
from people all over the country and only seventeen percent of those
people have been able to come and tell their stories at a hearing like
this the majority of those statements are going through the process of
the truth and reconciliation commission and we are investigating them and
coming to a decision whether a person is a victim or not and every
individual even those people today who will not be telling their
stories should have received a letter from the commission stating a
reference number and we will come back to them in the future as to the
decision that we have made i also want to say as my last point that for
those people who have not made a statement we have got statement takers
here today at the back of the hall upstairs as i understand it if
they want to make statements this is the opportunity do to do so if
you ’ve missed the opportunity the statement takers are some of not in
the i think one is actually living in this area now the others are in
rustenberg in mmabatha and they will come out with their plan as to when
they’ll come back to this area after today’s hearing so yes people
can continue making statements until officially until december we
won’t have statement takers after june but individuals can still sent
their statements in to us to our office and the office address is on the
back of the truth talk that is at the entrance of the organisation thank
you that’s those are all the points i want to make
	i want to introduce our panel today on my righthand side miss joyce
seroke who is a member of the human rights violations committee can i
just say that all of us are based in the johannesburg office of the truth
and reconciliation commission my name is fazel randera i’m going to be
chairing today’s proceedings i’m also a member of the human rights
violations committee dr russel ally next to me also a member of the
human rights violations committee and professor piet meiring who is a
member of the reparations and rehabilitations committee
	we have as i said earlier on got twelve people to listen to some of
those haven’t arrived as they arrive they will be incorporated in
today’s proceedings i hope everybody understands these little boxes
here today we have got a full interpretation service if people want a
box i think if you can just go to the side of the over there and you’ll
be handed these little black boxes i don’t know all the languages 
okay on the right hand side here there are some numbers and if you
twiddle the numbers you’ll actually get it either in english or tswana
so that’s available to people who wish to make use of it right
	can i then call our first witness for the day for the day lesego
sorry makganye lesego makganye thank you sir i’ve just been told that
english is on channel three sorry english on channel two and tswana on
channel three tate makganye good morning
can you please introduce the gentlemen who is with you
my name is lizo makganye the man next to me is elias mtsusi
thank you tate if you will just stand to take the oath
which professor meiring will help you with
mr makganye will you please stand up and put your hand in
the air and will you please repeat that everything i say will be the
truth nothing but the truth the whole truth so help me god
miss joyce seroke is going to be help you as you tell your
story to us i hand over to her
thank you sir mr makganye good morning
we welcome you thank you for i welcome you also and
together with the person with you you’re coming to tell us about the
disappearance of snowball on the th of april i ask you that
shortly explain to us what happened on that day
on that day there was a meeting at the anglican church it
was a youth meeting in that church the agenda was about the project
when they were there still there the police came they were led by mr
moletsani who was the leader of the police the chased out people outside
the hall i was not there when snowball went outside the hall he raised
his fist the police said we don’t want a person from mandela mr
moletsani hit with a baton now i don’t know the name of that baton but
they called it donkey pale snowball was able to protect himself
there’s a certain boy called motsepe he’s a tall and stout man he hit
him with a gun butt snowball fell on the ground and there was a certain
boy called pelane who killed snowball whilst he was on the ground
snowball fainted thereafter they took him to the police station which
was in a area called braklaagte
	when he arrived there they put him a sack and they assaulted him there
i’m disappointed because my the witness who was there is not here he’s
sick and he’s not present today if he was here i would ask for the
opportunity for her to explain her side of the story when she was asking
the police some questions about snowball they said to her why did you
not call him snowball to order my wife said she snowball did not tell
but the police did not tell what he did the police just said
he’s not here they said they were assaulting him because he’s coming
from mandela’s camp shortly i would say that is my story even myself
i went to ask mr moletsani that what is my what is the problem with my
son because you’ve assaulted him and now you have arrested him mr
moletsani told him that he’s naughty because he was raising his fist
this is not mandela’s place we are at lefurutsi i asked mr moletsani
why didn’t he just reprimand him i asked him again did he say anything
nothing then i asked him why did you assault him mr moletsani said i
assaulted him because he’s naughty you’ve got to teach him how to behave
	as i’m telling this story now he is mentally affected he’s always in
hospital and he’s always living under medication he has a wife and he
has a child i am not able to support my child who has been assaulted by
the boputhatswana police i asked mr moletsani many questions mr
moletsani told me that if the government said i should arrest the person
i do so i asked him again what did he do he just told me that he
raised his fist and that has raised the whole problem i don’t i didn’t
know that mandela was a problem to us or to everybody
	i ask the government that this government the previous government
didn’t do anything for us because after he has been arrested a certain
magistrate who was there at the time after he left the witness box when
the magistrate asked him what did you do snowball said i didn’t do
anything they just said i’ve raised my fist the magistrate instructed
him that he should not raised a fist you are guilty because you raised
your fist what did you do after he left the witness box he raised his
fist again in court the magistrate was very angry because he told him
that are you still raising your fist then he told him that he’s going
to rearrest him again snowball’s brother asked the magistrate how can
you arrest him by just raising a fist they were both arrested then i
pleaded with the magistrate that he should not arrest them he should
release them the magistrate cooperated then after the court
	during the prosecution i forgot the name of the magistrate he didn’t
allow my wife to give the statement because my wife was the one who was
asking mr moletsani some questions the second witness the coaccused
was put in the witness box but they didn’t take his testimony
	there was a certain boy again who was called by the police i asked the
prosecutor some questions i asked that boy as whether are you one of
the accused or were you together with those people because do you agree
that you’re going to be the witness for for snowball when they
adjourned again i asked that boy again are you a state witness this
boy told me again that snowball requested him to give evidence for him in
his favour but i told the boy that you are lying because snowball didn’t
ask you to come and witness for him i allowed him to be a state witness
but at the same time i wanted him to tow the line as whether he is
testifying for snowball or against snowball then they just said the
case is dismissed and they didn’t allow other witnesses to testify
during that court case that is how the case was dismissed
	i want the state to compensate my son and again to support his children
i don’t need anything i only need that the government should take care
should compensate snowball and again to take care of his children thank
	i can tell many many stories about the history of our history because
i’m one of the tribal council members i’m one of those that when the
police came when the mangope came and his soldiers came they were
talking to me and what they said to us if you ask they just said if
the president when the president spoke he has spoken if he said we
should arrest you we should arrest you
	a certain captain called moloi came and again a certain man if i don’t
remember if i remember his name his name correctly his name is
maraike he was the chief of the defence force he used to come early in
the morning around half past eight we would usually see them man the
roadblocks in our villages with small cars and big cars we used to
request them that they should not man roadblocks we showed them where
they usually put their roadblocks far from the village and the children
youth in our village were very angry with the police at that time there
is a certain man called manyape whom we usually asked that the youth
don’t want you here in our area we will not be able to reprimand them if
they want to do anything against the police the youth were able to chase
them away the police at that time together with the soldiers were able
to dismantle the tents there it was around nine o’clock
	during that same night they came with teargas all those soldiers
encompassed our village and shot us with the teargas and others died and
others were crippled you will hear among the witnesses today who are
going to tell about the death of their children and of those children who
were crippled it’s not only my son that are crippled here others who
were shot on their private parts they don’t have private parts now when
we asked they just said they just told us that whoever is adamant and
doesn’t want to take the authority of boputhatswana must leave but we
denied to leave and we are still there in our own land white people took
our land whilst they found us being there they would come and camp near
our village where we were staying before they would chase us out of our
own land because they would say the government has told us that we should
chase you out when you tried to go to the government in zeerust’s
offices that is where we used to come when you arrived there they would
just say our government has spoken in pretoria that you should leave
because your areas are black spots our boundary area was at mabutastad
and in the west was next to the botswana border we have a certain area
called zinogana which was called boputhatswana because it has been just
we just wanted to hear about what you have written in your
statement but now you’re telling us about the land we see now that
we’re going to ask you about
what happened to snowball and it seems you you have given us the
complete picture i would ask you to wait for questions now
	you said in your statement snowball and together with the youth met and
they were talking about boskop project can you explain about that
project what was that project about 
it was a project about agriculture talking about livestock
and to sell eggs and to plough vegetables even now a plot which we are
now going on with the project after that we were not ale to continue
there because we had many fights
this project you are telling us about was it part of the
no it was a village project it has nothing to do with
politics i don’t know anything about politics and the police came and
chased them out and assaulted them
what was the cause that the police should do that 
what made them to do that is there was a struggle in our
village because mangope wanted us to be his people and to be amalgamated
in boputhatswana and we rejected that request and he came to build a
so you denied to be amalgamated in boputhatswana
yes we denied because we even went as far a pretoria and
when you said snowball raised his fist was he in which
i don’t know because we people of the african national
congress at the time we knew that if you’d raise a black power sign at
any time i didn’t know that snowball by raising a black power sign i
don’t know the sign of that raising of the fist because the police just
said if you raise your fist you are a member of the anc
was he a member of the anc or not 
we were anc members and he was anc members and he’s still an
he’s in johannesburg we took him to baragwanath hospital and
he was better he was working he’s working at the government offices at
that time during the political strife he ran to a certain area and when
he went back he started to work at that government office he is working
even though he is sick even if he is sick but the government allow him
is he still working by now 
yes he’s working other days he’s working other days he
goes to the hospital because he doesn’t get sick all the time
i see in your statements that there are medical reports and
reports from the magistrate i want to ask about esther makganye is she
the mother to this is she the mother to the child 
yes she was the mother to the child she was there when
snowball was assaulted esther ran away behind the clinic but the one
who was talking to the police was elizabeth makganye who is my wife
in your statement again i see is mr tallie who was the
chairperson of of that meeting did mr tallie and esther give statements
yes they did hand over their statements they only allowed
mr tallie to give their statement
i was talking about statements for the truth commission no
they were not there when the truth commission staff came but
they may be available if the opportunity arises for them to hand over
their statements as i said she’s not she doesn’t want to come because
because the police would shoot them because she said the police told them
that they should not be seen again around the magistrate offices
we’d want esther to meet with our staff or our statement
taker because there will be no police who would harass her we would ask
the person who can give a true statement is elizabeth because
she confronted the police and though esther was there but she didn’t
engage the police at that time she saw with her eyes but she was at a
distance but she saw whatever has happened there
we will try ask our statement takers to get her to make a
statement we will try to tell them that they should testify in this
regard those who have assaulted snowball abraham maletsani elias
are they still working as police 
yes they’re still working in boputhatswana molentsani knows
we thank you i’ve finished i would ask our chairperson to
mr makganye thank you for telling the story there are a
number of things i would like to ask still you said that your son
you are free you can ask your questions sir
thank you very much your son is married was he married
he married before he was tortured as you know that our
children just sit together and then after that they made a legal wedding
then during that time even before then they were just sitting together
but after that they married they married legally
the child is that a boy or a girl 
i cannot remember her name i cannot remember her name she’s
still young and because they’re staying in johannesburg they’re not
staying with us therefore i cannot remember her name
no problem we will get it from them you said that he is
he can still work what type of work does he do at the government office 
he’s working as a messenger last time when he came he said
he’s studying for electricity and he’s engaged in the electrical work in
he has some training he went to school and he had
training as was he being trained as an electrician 
because he’s there and i’m here i don’t know as whether he
was taken for some courses but he’s well versed with you know with
education yes he did go to school
what standard did he complete was he in standard six or
then after standard eight he was engaged in the struggle
then he left school to other areas
thank you so much those were the questions i wanted to
let me not speak much if i forgot other things when i
remember them i should be given an opportunity to to put them forward
i just want to ask you one more question i just want to
you are free to ask me some questions sir
you said earlier on when you were speaking to miss seroke
that that there was a struggle of the people of braklaagte against
incorporation but that was around interrupted tate
sorry can i finish but this happened in what was happening in
 that made the police come in such large numbers back into
the community and take such action against the people 
they did so because we did not want to be incorporated in
boputhatswana and that we should enter
but incorporation had taken place already we’re talking
about we’re not talking about incorporation had taken place
do you say we were incorporated in boputhatswana 
do you say we were amalgamated in boputhatswana in we
didn’t agree when they immediately they said we were incorporated we
did not agree we continued with our struggle because we knew that there
was nothing called boputhatswana it’s part of south africa
boputhatswana just changed yesterday we denied that we should be
amalgamated to boputhatswana they did so on their own but we agreed we
disagreed they assaulted us so as to force us to be incorporated into
can i then just ask why you and the people were so much
against incorporation into boputhatswana why did you want to stay part
of south africa at that stage 
we see that it was not proper to be incorporated into
can you add a little more to that tate what do you mean 
the reasons for our rejection is that they didn’t negotiate
they didn’t tell us that we are from boputhatswana we are going to
that area after we have spent our monies and our resources so they just
came and say if a person just say go out of your house you cannot just
take it easily what can you do if somebody just come into your house and
say leave that house whilst you’re still in love with that house
thank you tate we don’t have any further questions i want
to thank you for coming here today and sharing your understanding of
what happened in this area as well as what happened to your son we’re
very glad to hear that despite the treatment that he received at the
hands of the then police bop police he has made a sufficiently strong
recovery to be able to work in johannesburg and we have heard your
he’s not completely healed he’s working because he’s
i understand that tate but he is working that’s the
important thing that he has made that sort of recovery but thank you
very much for coming and we will come back to you in due course
mrs moitoi welcome again we are very happy to have you
and we are privileged to listen to your story it again takes us back to
april when you underwent a very harrowing experience would you
like to tell us in your own words what happened on that day and
thanking you for welcoming me i’m your child johanna moitoi
boputhatswana soldiers came forcing us to accept whatever they do and
whatever they say they were not bringing peace or with humility but
they were fighting when they arrived at my house they said to me we are
coming to take you they were about twelve in number but all of them were
men when they arrived at home i was with my friend my fiancé he asked
them what are they taking me for then they said they said i will
they did that they assaulted me and burnt me on my hands i was burnt on
both hands let me show you my scars because this is a memory to me then
i just gave up and allowed then to burn me because i said whatever they
want me to do i will do then we boarded the police van to a certain man
called mita sigwilwa that’s where they build tents there
	we were taken by a police van to motswele we were assaulted by them i
was with joyce modise they didn’t accept anything which we said but
they wanted us to accept anything they say they said to me who’s your
chief i told them that i was given been commissioned that mr sebogodi
was my chief then they told me that he he is no more a chief that the
chief is now adrian weelwa but i did not accept that because everything
which happens in a community that should be have been informed that our
chief is now weelwa i was assaulted because my chief is mr sebogodi
even now the chief is papsi sebogodi i didn’t know anything any
information that mr weelwa is the chief being assaulted by the soldiers
and the police was was that the say but belief that i should believe
what they say but i continued with my convictions
	i was taken to motswele i arrived in a group of police and they we
were assaulted because we they wanted us to say that adrian weelwa is
our chief and believe accept that our land should be amalgamated to
boputhatswana i didn’t know i didn’t know of any importance that we
should be amalgamated to boputhatswana feel that their government was
oppressive and assaulting people we couldn’t accept boputhatswana
because we were beaten whilst we were at motswele my fiancé came but he
was told that i’m going to stay in prison for five years so he accepted
that then i accepted that also
	after after a while after eight o’clock after i was it’s been told
that the why i was there then i was taken back home by the police van
i didn’t appear in court and that’s what i said that but i was assaulted
thank you very much for telling the story can i just
start at the beginning again where were you working before on the day
during the time when they arrested you
i was having a one year seven months child i was still at
but you didn’t you work with the local 
interrupted you said that in your statement you said that you worked
at the local authority and that the people wanted you to make a statement
that the money was misused by the local authority is that so 
they didn’t understand what i was saying if we were at the
village we were asked to collect money to build an office where
pensioners would receive their pension but i was not receiving any
so that was the reason why that was what they wanted you
to say in your statement you say that when you were arrested you
together with five other people were taken to a tent and horrible things
were done to you then would you like to tell us about that or do you
prefer not to tell us about that 
being burnt while whilst your looking being burnt with fire
in the statement in the written statement there’s also
mention of a device that was put between your legs that you were
shocked would you like to tell about that or is it not important to
it’s too i’m ashamed to talk about that
it’s on paper and we have it thank you for that another
another very terrible thing that happened was that your sister was so
shocked when she heard about your arrest that she fell she collapsed and
she died of shock would you like to tell about that 
that’s my sister that’s my sister that’s lydia moitoi who
as the result of your being arrested
he died of he died of a heart attack he didn’t have this
thank you mrs moitoi only a few questions more you
talked about your fiancé after you were free to go did you marry 
children you have to take care of 
yes there are children whom i’m taking care of
the firstborn is was born in he’s doing standard
eight the second born is doing standard seven he was born in the
third one is doing standard six was born in of the one whom i was
pregnant with was born in and he’s doing standard two
you are working at the moment as a sales lady in zeerust
yes i’m working at a shop
i just want to one ask one more question and then i’ll
pass onto my colleagues what happened to you that you being a lady was
arrested and brutalised did that happen very often were there many
women who suffered from the boputhatswana police what happened to you
was very bad you’re a lady you’re a woman and you were assaulted by the
police were there many other women that were assaulted similarly 
yes there were there were many
thank you very much no more questions from my side
if i can ask one or two questions please your statement says
that you were accused of burning down houses why would they make that
they were just forcing you know those kind of statements to
me it was because of the oppressive attitude that they had at that time
were there houses that were burnt down in the area in this
yes many houses were burnt during that time
and you politically do you did you have were you were you
yes i was a member of african national congress
african national congress was still banned at that point in
fact even after in the bop area they continued to outlaw the anc so
when you say you’re a member of the anc in what do you mean 
i worked i worked with them from them until now because
they supported me all the time
so you mean are you saying in were you a member of the anc
or were you just generally supportive of the policy of the anc or were
you an actual member of any anc structures the anc underground in 
i was member of the anc which was which was public then it
was not underground then i have their membership cards with me
then we were speaking about after because the anc was only
unbanned in february so we’re speaking about after but at the
time where you known to be politically outspoken why would they
have come and picked you up in particular and accused you and tortured
you what reason would they have had
they wanted me to force me to be a member of boputhatswana
but when i denied they said which means you are part of those people
but i’m still trying to understand now i hope you don’t mind
that was when they actually had already picked you up not so that they
tried to force you to make a false statement that was after they picked
you up but what i’m trying to understand why would they have gone to
you in particular before you were picked up why would they have singled
you out to be to be to be picked up did you have a were you known to
be a political activist had you spoken out against certain things 
were you friendly with people who were considered to be political
activists why why would they have gone for you that’s what i could
when they came to me they came to me with a person whom we
were elected together to collect money which means they came with
somebody who knew where i was staying
the money that you were collecting this was for this was for a
pension fund but you were accused of collecting for other purposes 
we were collecting two rands from each person or each house
and this money was going to be used for what purpose 
we wanted to build a hall with that money so that when they
received their pension their pension grants they’d be able to gather
there when the government agencies come to give them their pensions
special was there a special committee that was appointed to
collect this money is that is that how it worked or 
and this committee had a treasurer and and proper records were
kept and everything like that is that how it worked 
now the person who came with the police was the was also part
of this committee collecting this money yes 
now what did this person did this person give the police false
information or what what was going on 
i didn’t know how they approached her or him but to me they
came because he was directing the police to my house but he left in the
police van and the police came on their own
was this person also tortured or any anything happen to this
when you were testifying you said you were under chief
you didn’t know that mr moilo is now the chief of your area
what were the stands of chief sebogodi 
we took him we regarded him as our chief as we knew that
that he he was our chief
when they came to you they saw you because you were
collecting monies from people were they young people or was it the whole
as we said we were the youth we had our book and the old
when they did what you don’t want to tell us about did you
go to the police to report what they did to you 
i didn’t even dare try because i still going to appear to the
did you tell the doctor what they did to you 
yes i did explain to the doctor and when i came back i
found the road block then they teared up those papers
johanna sorry just a few more questions and then we’re
finished i just want to understand your perspective of what was going on
between chief sebogodi and chief molilwa
conflict that was taking place in the area at the time
the conflict was brought about by the police because they
said to us adrian molilwa is the chief and we as a community we didn’t
know that adrian molilwa was the chief we know that when a new chief is
introduced the whole community is invited to be informed about that but
i knew that at that time the chief was lm sebogodi then i was even
given a third tale about the history of sebogodi then i knew that
sebogodi was the chief and i there was no way in which i couldn’t
understand that he was the chief i told them straight in their faces
that sebogodi is the chief of legobo village
and the association between incorporation of the area into
boputhatswana was that did that feature in this whole discussion that
the chief was against chief sebogodi was against
incorporation whereas the other chief seemed happy to go along with it 
i would say chief molilwa yes agreed because all meetings
were held in his place so which means he agreed that we should be
and you said earlier on that there were many houses that
were burnt down whose houses were being burnt down and by whom were
they supporters of one faction against or another faction or was it
police officers whose houses were being burnt down 
the house i understand about the incidents was the house
belonging to mr selomi when they inspected the damage it was found that
it was the police who did that
my last question is to do with the this collection of money
that you were that you were involved in for the hall was that purely on
yes i volunteered because after seeing the suffering of old
age people because they were staying in the sun and in the rain
that’s part of it but the actual collecting of money from
other people did they also offer the money voluntarily 
yes they were volunteering in their contributions
now that brings to the end all the questioning is there
anything else you would like to say 
if there’s anything else that you want to add to what’s been
to continue i would wish that those people who did all who
were victims as myself their names should appear and that they should be
taken care of by the truth commission
thank you johanna i just want to thank you for coming here
today please don’t feel that all these questions that we’ve been posing
you is to make life more difficult to you it’s just that we want to
understand the context in which it took place it doesn’t take away what
happened to you both at the camp and at the police station and we thank
you today for coming and sharing those experiences with us and we hear
what you’ve said in terms of the needs of victims to be recognised thank
i said i would keep people informed about statement taking
there are people at the back of the hall who are taking statements and if
you want to have a statement taken please if you’ll proceed to the back
of the hall thank you very much

say is the truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so help me god
thank you and welcome to you john you you’re coming to speak
about a very horrific experience something that happened to you
personally in in january a period or a time when there was
great unrest in the former homeland former boputhatswana this was a
year after the anc had been unbanned in the country as a whole but there
was still serious problems in bop about the rights of the anc to actually
operate freely it produced a lot of conflict and a lot of people were
caught up in this conflict and you were one of those so i’d like you
just to give us an account of what actually happened to you during that
it was on the th in it was on tuesday we went
to mr selomi’s house we were going to pray because his house was burnt
and the police came when they arrived they shot us with teargas and
rubber bullets and living bullets after that we dispersed and others
were injured and i was also a victim because they shot me and they took
me to the hospital at lefurutsi that’s all
how old were you at the time of this incident can you remember
and what were you doing at the time were you at school were
now you say that that there was this a prayer meeting right
because the house of this family had been burnt was this did this
prayer meeting did it was there any kind of political aspect to it 
was it was it also about about the political conflict taking place at
yes there was political conflict at the time
this prayer meeting at this house the man whose house was
burnt was he seen as a was he politically active 
why was his why was his house burnt 
we don’t know how it was burnt
did you have any idea of who burnt the house were there any
rumours any stories about who was responsible for burning his house 
this is mr soluma this is the person you’re speaking about is that
i don’t know the people who burnt the house
the person whose house was burnt you said the name was it soluma
 is that the name that you mentioned 
and you don’t know why the house was burnt and you don’t know
you don’t have an idea who was supposed to have burnt the house 
i don’t know how to put it
put it the best way that you that you can whichever way you
want to put it and we and we will see if we can work out what you’re
his house was burnt because he was supporting papsi
so it was part of this conflict with these two chiefs that
yes that’s true it was part of this conflict between
and you were twenty years old at the time were you involved in
aany structures any youth structures or political structures or any
i was a member of the african national congress at the
when did you become a member of the african national congress 
i the answer is not clear sir
was this sorry we didn’t i did hear you when did you say
you became a member of the african national congress 
thanks so at this house at this prayer meeting was it known
that these were anc people or supporters of the anc who also supported
the chief segodi was that the nature of that prayer meeting is that
now when the police arrived the bop the boputhatswana police
did they give any instructions to the people there did they say you
have five minutes to disperse this is an illegal gathering what
actually happened when the police arrived 
i heard a loudspeaker talking saying we should
disperse whilst we were trying to disperse then they started shooting us
with the rubber bullets and teargas then others were injured then some
was anybody killed on that day do you know 
what about the people who were killed what do you know about
i know about george segwati that’s all
he was shot and then he was taken to hospital then he
died in hospital i we were in the same van when we were taken to the
so you were taken to hospital and at the hospital what did
they find out had happened to you
sorry i didn’t hear that just repeat that please ok no never
mind let’s continue when you got to hospital they discovered that
you’d actually been been shot interrupted
yes they saw that i was shot
right and tell us about that where had you been shot 
was that live ammunition or was that the rubber bullets who
what what what had you been shot what had you been shot with 
it was a live bullet sir
so when you got to the hospital what did they have to do to
you because of this because of the way you had been shot 
on my way to the hospital i fainted therefore i don’t
remember what happened in the hospital
but you had an operation when you were in hospital yes they
and were your testicles removed as a result of the way you had
and did you have to continue to go into the hospital for
yes i continued at the hospital for medical attention
but i was never better i was taken to harankwe hospital at harankwe
they tried they did try to help me after i was released i went to
johannesburg hospital general hospital that’s where i was a little bit
and now what’s the situation what’s happening to you and
it’s no more the same as before before i was shot but
now i feel many pains when i think of what has happened to me i become
and do you continue to go to hospital for any for any treatment
still or are you on medication of any kind 
yes i’m on medication i collect my tablets at the
and did you ever have any counselling did you ever have anyone
come and speak to you about what happened and go through these events
with you did you have anything like that at at any point a social
worker or a councillor or a nurse anybody speak to you about what
happened to you explain to you the meaning of all of this
i didn’t get social workers but i met social workers in
johnnesburg because i was sent there by the lawyers
and the social workers in johannesburg what did they do did
they speak to you did they 
yes they spoke with me then they took me to general
hospital before i went to johannesburg i went through to johannesburg
general hospital through the lawyers then they took me to a specialist
and then from there i was taken to the social workers then the social
workers sent me to the general hospital in johannesburg
do you have any contact with the social with social workers now
 do do you still speak to anybody 
i don’t speak to them by now
now tell us about this with the lawyers is this are these the
lawyers who are representing you have you laid charges against the
after we were shot we were arrested for public
violence then we were taken to hospital after coming back from
hospital i was sent back to prison
sent back to prison on and how long did they keep how long were
i don’t remember how long but i think it’s four days
you were charged with public violence that was the charge
yes i was charged with public violence
did you ever have to appear in court 
yes i did appear in court
tell us about that what happened you had a lawyer representing
you and and and others who had been charged is that not so 
yes i was represented by a lawyer
can you tell us about what happened in court 
we were found guilty about public violence we were
sentenced for five years but they were set aside
so it was a suspended sentence 
and did you have to pay any fines or anything like that 
no i didn’t pay any fine
in your statement i was trying to see the name of the lawyer i
don’t see you mention the name of the lawyer can you remember who the
we were represented by mam rebenbach he stays in
zeerust reben rebenbach if that is a clear pronunciation breyt
now this suspended sentence for how long was it suspended
because you know when they normally do this they say five years
suspended for eighteen months for one year can you can you remember
more specifically the actual sentence after you were found guilty
we were sentenced for five years
right that was suspended right the five years was suspended
can you remember if they said for how long in order words if
you commit something similar in a year or two years you can then get the
five years that’s how it normally works can you remember if you can’t
that’s fine because we can get those details from the lawyer if you
can’t remember then don’t worry if you can then that is helpful to us
ok and did you ever consider laying a charge yourself against
the police for for what happened to you did you ever discuss with your
did you know who these policemen were who came and fired can
you would you be able to identify any one of them more than one 
i will not identify them because it the situation was
confusing i saw some policemen in court
you didn’t know any of them at the time and you still and you
say now you wouldn’t be able to to name anyone or identify anyone
the one i know is captain masisako
where is this captain interrupted where is he where is
he was at motsweti police station i don’t know where
can you tell us a little bit about your present situation now
how do you cope how do you survive who provides for you 
i’m struggling in life because i’m sick i’m not able
to work for myself and that is not possible because of my health state
and at home they’re struggling also
who do you live with presently 
and they take care of you your mother and your sisters take
and you personally what that you hope can be done in your
situation when you came to the truth commission what is it that you
why were you coming to the truth commission 
my desire is financial help maybe i’ll forget the
and what about schooling what standard did you complete at
and then you stopped going to school 
why did something happen that made you stop what 
we are struggling at home we’re living we’re living
below the bread line therefore they didn’t have means to take us to
any political issues or community issues what 
thank you very much i’ll give you back to to the chairperson
only two very brief questions one is to do with your
emotional state you said that you are still emotionally very disturbed
and you’re not receiving any treatment at the moment would you like
treatment do you feel that you need treatment for that 
yes i’m in need of help sir
yes i have bad mess at night
and just a last thing you mentioned the name of george
segwati who was shot on the very same day as you were shot was he killed
do you know if his parents or if his family have made a
can i ask you if you have if you still know where the
people live where the sekwati family live that you will advise them that
we would like a statement from them telling about their son 
then we ask you to please go to them and say that we would
like to have a statement from them
john thank you very much is there anything else you want
yes there’s something i want to say the last thing i
want to say is i wanted to ask on my behalf to mr mangope that how did
he come to lekobo in our area can you ask mr mangope because many
things which has happened at home if it was not because of him we could
not have been in the problems we have there could not have been somebody
who has been crippled so can you ask mr mangope and captain selike to
ask them why did they send police in our area because we were living in
peace and there were no conflict before there could not have been a
person who has been crippled but immediately they entered our village
the conflict started we were living in peace but immediately they came
that’s when we started to have problems i thought maybe if were as i
was saying this mr selike or mr mangope they could have been here they
could have been here so that they should be asked many questions that
what what were the reasons to them to come to lekobo because it seems
they are responsible for our suffering that that’s the thing which
disturbed me all the time there was no there there were no houses
which were burnt before and there were no people who were killed before
but immediately they came in the people were incarcerated they were
imprisoned and our parents were staying in the veld and others were
john thank you very much i don’t think any words can
describe what happened to you at the time and i’m sure what has happened
to you since you have so eloquently said what your family situation is
at the moment and i hope that within the new south africa there is place
for you to actually continue some form of education and to be able to get
a job i’m sure that professor meiring has listened very carefully in
terms of your needs and in time we will come back to you on that we wish
you well in the future thank you very much for coming

your patience magdeline you’re also going to tell us about what happened
in in lekobo many stories we have heard today already this
famous camp or yard of mr molilwa features in your suffering and pain as

it was in it was good friday it was on a friday at
two o’clock in the morning i heard an unusual knock i asked who is
knocking but i was frightened a man’s voice came ahead saying open for
us then i went out when i opened a group of people entered and they
couldn’t all of them get into the house when they came to me they said
to me we are looking for a woman are you motsosi magdeline i said
yes they said the book which you have where is it we had a discussion
with the old people that there should be a hall which should be used by
the old aged people then they said we should have a place which should
be used for old aged people’s pension so that we should not disturb
people at school at that time i was having a hundred rand because we
were collecting those two rands then i said i don’t have money i only
have a hundred rand with me they took that hundred rand after i gave
them that hundred rand i said is that enough because they were having
guns and many kinds of armaments then they said let’s go we’ll bring you
back then they said to me who is gibone then they said is she’s i
said i told them she staying on the other side of the village i put on
	i saw many men in the yard i went with them then i knocked at that
door then they said who are you i said motlaoile then i said open
they we’ve been sent to you when she opened the door she saw many
people standing then they took us again then we asked where are you
taking us to then they said you belong to organisations which bring
problems to our village we went with them on the road a certain man
clapped me then that person said to me you belong to organisations
which our president doesn’t like then the other one said leave the
woman alone we’ll see her later we went with them again we arrived at
adrian mwelilo’s house we entered there then they locked us in their
police vans then we found many people around who were arrested or
detained in that area as you want to sleep they will start shouting to
	then they said here is your chief they said wake up then we were
taken with their cars then they said take out your blanket they said
sit down a certain man came with a sjambok and said i’m going to hit you
with this he said sleep i was moving from the distance from that
corner to that corner i was wet at that time all my clothes were wet
then even my dresses would go up and see my face then they would take a
certain lady then they said come to the grass so that we they did
those things because they wanted us not to sleep the whole night they
were making us wet and they were casting aspersions to us when you want
to pass water they say just pass water anywhere
	early in the morning we were put in the police vans then they said
who is your chief we told them that is mr sebogodi is the chief then
they said you know nothing your chief is mr molilwa whom you are
giving problems we told them that we were not told that mr molilwa is
the chief we know that when a tribal meeting we’ll even see mr molilwa
at mr sebogodi’s place we were made wet by hosepipes and we were
sjamboked we were beaten all of us the were men and women it was
confusing and people were screaming all over you’ll hear even men
screaming those they did those things on saturday and sunday and they
made us to write statements saying mr molilwa is our chief and that mr
sebogodi is not our chief we knew that all of us we were living
peacefully all of us wewere made to make statements and others were
made wet and many people were assaulted our lawyers came then they took
about two loads of people and others were left there in the cells they
were making us they were hiding us because lawyers were coming
	on the second day again we were going to mpogeng because they already
told us we are a wanted animal i was one of those people who went to
mpogeng we bought tshirts and i was one of them who bought tshirts i
put on mandela’s tshirt when we arrived on the crossroads there is a
cross which goes to welwedacht there was a roadblock on the day which we
were supposed to go to mpogeng they stopped our cars then they said
who is where is magdeline motsosi they said come here then they said
 what were you going to do in mpogeng i told them i don’t know what we
were going to do they wanted me to tell what was going to be said at
mpogeng then i told them that i will tell them when i come back one of
them said he must phone a station commander called dube we don’t know
these policemen who were there then then they phoned then his answer
	i was taken to a police van because i was thought to be a leader then
they took us to welwedacht we were taken to a charge office they took
me to mr dube saying this is the woman we brought her here then he
asked me where are you going what are you going to do what’s the
agenda just tell us in short what is going to be said there i told
them that i don’t know anything i’ll hear when i arrived there then he
said are you one of the trouble makers in our area look what you are
wearing this is the man who makes you adamant he clapped me my lips
were cracked he teared tore off my shirt my tshirt then there was a
certain boy who was wearing that tshirt he tied him with his shoes the
lawyer called breytenbach arrived and then they chased me out they
released us that we should meet her at the gate then they said we must
	we arrived at pikinos i with my tshirt torn i slept thirteen days in
detention at motswedi with the anc membership cards with me he was he
was having a gun he said i can shoot you now that’s all i can say
magdeline thank you very much magdeline so there’s not time
for too many questions one of the things that interests me though is
why was there so much interest from the side of boputha the police the
boputhatswana police in this committee that you were also part of this
this committee that collected this money from people in the village this
two rand why were they so interested in this committee do you have any
i even now i cannot understand why they had a special desire
about this committee is it because of the conflict between the two
chiefs as you were saying as they were saying who was our chief and
that they were forcing us to say our chief was mr molilwa that means the
conflict between the two chiefs was the cause of the problem
that’s true that seems to be that the political context the
background this conflict between chief mobolilwa and and the other
chief but earlier on another deponent witness also spoke about the
interest of the police in this committee and this collection of this two
rand and dr randera asked where the people gave this two rand of their
own free will or were people obliged to contribute two rand what was
the situation with the collection of this two rand from people in the
this money which was collected we were not forcing people
but it was out of our desire that we don’t have a hall which we can have
beauty contests then we were ask accommodation at the school then there
was this idea of saying we should have our own hall because that’s
where we wanted to have our cultural activities there
how often was it collected was it once a week once a month 
how often was this money collected from people 
we were arrested in good friday we are many as the
villagers and i was having hundred rand with me
i was asking how often was this two rand collected was it on
a weekly basis on a monthly basis 
did each household have to pay or each person how how did
this work it was on a monthly basis was it two rand per house two
rand per person how was how was the two rand collected 
it was two rand per person and children was one rand each
what if people didn’t have money what happened in that
there was no problem because any time you get money you’ll
what if somebody just refused to pay what if i what if
somebody said i don’t have to pay this money because i don’t want this
hall i’m not interested what would happen in a situation like this 
we didn’t have such a case of a person who said he doesn’t
want to contribute to that fund
did anybody ever complain about this did they go to do you
think that people may perhaps have gone to the boputhatswana police and
because we were arrested just so suddenly i didn’t have that
kind of an idea that maybe there are people who are complaining in the
let’s say there was a case of in one house there were six
people living in that house was it expected that every month that house
would have to pay twelve rand for let’s say there were six adults 
that that house had to pay twelve rand every month is that how it
it could have been so because we as the youth volunteered
on our own that we’re going to contribute our rands and the parents
and are you sure that that this was never a source of conflict
that some people may have perhaps felt that it was unfair because in
some houses there may have been three people and in another house there
may have been six people in another house there may been two people and
yet everyone was expected who lived in a house to contribute the same
amount was this never a source of conflict at all 
i would say it that that might be the source of the problem
or of the conflict because when the police came they started by saying
now you said that there was this conflict between these chiefs
okay now did the chiefs take any position or side in this collection of
this money was the one chief for it and the other chief said i’m
against it do you have any idea of the way the chiefs felt about this
collection of money in the village 
there was no conflict about that contribution because there
and it was the youth that you said or this committee made up of
the youth that was responsible for this money 
did you ever consider laying a charge against these policemen
who assaulted you who humiliated you in the way in which they did did
you because you spoke about the lawyer you mentioned breytenbach i
yes we met with the lawyers
the lawyers help us that we should not be imprisoned
so you were you were never you were never charged in court
were you were you taken to court at any point 
we appear in court but other groups did appear in court
presently where this other chief that you speak about
molilwa where is he presently is he still in the village what
and what is the relationship like between him and the other
chief and the rest of the people in the village 
since the start of the conflict i see that we it will not
come back that conflict would not come back again even if you don’t know
the deepest heart of a person
 the whole community still feel now is the
community reconciled are there still deep divisions antagonisms 
what the conflict may have gone as you say but within the community
there are no social groups as it were which divide the
and the local government elections what actually happened in
the area did people just vote for whichever party they wanted to or
was there conflict or did everything go off smoothly 
there was no conflict at all during the local government
thank you i don’t have anymore questions
only a few brief questions mrs motsosi i just want to
how many children do you have to take care of
the other one was born in the other one was born in

he still living in the same house 
the same yard is still there are the police still there 
you said there is peace now in your village 
he’s staying at home and he’s an old person
we heard much about this police station which was in
motswedi is it in your area or is it in zeerust 
it’s on the other side of lefurutse
may i ask if sisinyana rantao has arrived mrs rantao good
mrs rantao professor piet meiring is going to assist you in
telling your story but before he does that can i ask miss seroke to
assist you in taking the oath please
i would ask you to stand up please you swear that the story
you are about to tell is the truth and nothing else but the truth so
mrs rantao can you hear me 
thank you for coming you want to tell us about your son
elliot mokoena eight years ago when he was twenty eight years old
something happened in your family something happened to him please tell
in my son arrived at home then that time there was
confusion or there was political conflict at that time he was working
at a mine in rustenberg he arrived late in the afternoon around seven
o’clock then there was an unrest in our area then he entered the house
then we stayed with him in the house then from there we went to sleep
my son went to his bedroom to sleep then after that i heard footsteps
in my house then they were fast then they knocked and they were pushing
the doors then somebody said open so i said who are you because i’m
an old woman then they said open up i woke up after that they’ve
already opened the bedroom where my son was sleeping they didn’t give
him time they took him with the guns then they said to me go and
sleep you old woman then when i asked where are you taking him to
they dragged him outside and the police cars were surrounding the house
and the police were in the house and together with the soldiers they
put him in a hippo and other his siblings were also in that police van
	tomorrow morning when i wanted to find out what happened to them they
were taken to motswedi police station i went to motswedi police station
they were at welgedacht they were locked in a cell i went back home i
slept then when they were taken to court when they were released at
home he had his leg bandaged because he was tortured he didn’t say
anything he took his bag and said i’m going i’m running away because
they’re going to arrest me again my son then left
	then the unrest went on my son just disappeared we didn’t see him
again since he left that day even up to now we haven’t seen him i
haven’t seen him since that day whether he has died or what happened to
thank you mrs rantao we’ve listened to your story thank
you that you told it to us may we talk a little bit about the
disappearance of your son i just want to know why did the police pick
on him was he a political activist was he known amongst his friend that
he was a visitor arriving from work he didn’t know that
there is an unrest i don’t even understand about this political activity
so it was just a horrible mistake
i believe it was a mistake for the police to come and fetch
him because he was just arriving he didn’t even went around in our
he was twenty years old did he work at that stage 
yes he was working in rustenberg
he was working at swartklip mine
he was still young he wasn’t married yet
were there any children were there any children that he
so he had to take care of his mother 
yes he was looking after me
so he was sent then to prison and he was released and
and on that day he came home with his leg bandaged and he
said he had enough he wanted to leave did you have do you have any 
then said he’s running away because they may rearrest him
and you have no idea where he went and that was not the
only bad thing that happened to you your mother pauline that her house
was also burnt was that related to this incident or was that completely
after that the house was burnt we fled we were no more at
that place i think in they took my property inside the house but i
so that was two years later your son’s disappearance was
in and the burning down of your mother’s house was in 
my child disappeared in and my house was burnt my
are you working at the moment 
i try to look for him even in johannesburg i went even in
the hospitals in krugersdorp and other areas i went to the police in
johannesburg but i couldn’t i couldn’t find any trace then i went back
at the moment are you working are you employed 
how many children do you have to look after 
i have three children and the other one is a cripple
mrs rantao thank you i’ve made notes and those are the
questions i needed to ask i hand over to the chairman
ma sisinyana was you son working in rustenberg in the mines
didn’t you hear anything of maybe what happened in the mines
that when he arrived at home they came and picked him up 
i don’t understand because i didn’t hear any kind of a
at home when at the time when he was picked up what was
it was during the time of the unrests it was during april
in good friday and he came as a person who’s come for a holiday he was
they were people were fighting in the village
we were fighting with the police
i would i would not understand what was the problem
he arrived at a time when you were taken by the police or
maybe was it quiet at that time 
he arrived at seven o’clock in the evening but during that
time the this fight was going on then we slept and then the police
were the police going house to house or they came to your
it’s not only my house but it’s they weren’t in the whole
village he was not the only child who was arrested but many many people
were shot and many people were arrested boys and girls it was just the
in your statements you say you are staying in a shack

mrs rantao thank you very very much for coming we see and
we hear your suffering to have lost a son at such a young age and still
not knowing where he is must be frightening i want to appeal actually

today who can give us any information about this young man i think that
the opportunity is here we can we can take that information from you

sorry maybe you should just stand again will you please
say declare that everything you will say you will be saying will be the
truth the whole truth nothing but the truth so help me god
you’re coming to speak to us about a very painful experience an
incident which took place in january that affected you and your
entire family and also led to the death of one of your children surprise
sefularo i’m going to ask you now in your own words if you will just
go through what happened on that day of the th of january 
ma’am can i just stop you for one minute we don’t seem to
be getting the translations it’s now okay it’s now clear 
on the th of january we were asleep at that time i
was woken up by a noise of people thereafter i heard my window panes
breaking immediately people were gathered inside the house then i could
see that these people were fighting they came to me and stuck me with a
knife after that i tried to hide myself i couldn’t help it because i
had five children in the house at that time immediately thereafter i
went outside to look for my children i found three children the fourth
one is surprise whom i didn’t find at that time i was helpless at that
time i was having one child with my right hand and the other one on my
	then we went to mr tiro’s house mr tiro took me to the hospital whilst
i was on the way the ambulance took me to the hospital i was made an
operation to remove the blade from my left hand two children slept in
the hospital for two days the other one slept for three days in the
hospital that’s how far i go
i just want to ask you a few questions if you don’t mind
i just want to ask you a few questions if you don’t mind
mainly based on your statement you say that more than thirty people
entered your house that evening is
that correct is that what you remember 
now you say that you later learnt that these were anc people
how did you find out that information 
i learnt that during the struggle they denied that our
children should go to school and those who were working at the government
at that time in boputhatswana could easily be killed one of them was
at school and the other one was a policeman in the bop police
no ma’am maybe you didn’t understand me correctly you say in
your statement that these people who came to your house who attacked you
and your family who set fire to your house who stabbed you who you
believe are responsible for the death of your daughter you say that you
learnt that they were anc members now did somebody tell you that or did
you identify any of the people how did you find out or learn that these
i just learnt from my own observation that they were that
can you explain a little bit to us how do you mean your own
observations did they did they have anc tshirts on or what was it that
convinced you that they were actually members of the anc or anc
my observation was based on the following
gatherings there would the anc people would go to house to house but
they could not come to my house all the time
ma’am these of these thirty people did you recognise anybody
know anyone of that group that came to your house 
i was not able to identify anyone of them because they just
broke windows came inside and assaulted me and my family
so you wouldn’t know if they were from your area or another area
i was not able to see as whether they come from our village
now you say that you were you were stabbed by one of these
people who came into your house stabbed you
yes on the shoulder i was stabbed on the shoulder and the
you say that you believe that one of the reasons why these
people came to your house one of the possible reasons was because you
had a son who was in the police who was part of the boputhatswana
police where was that son at at interrupted
the other one was attending school whilst the schools were
but one of your sons were still attending school even though
he was attending school at tsongotwane village
okay now your who who is the policeman where was he at the
he was hammaskraal training college at that time
now before this incident before this night of january did you
any other conflicts or confrontations with people in your village 
people were leaving the area to zeerust and other areas and
then we were left we were the only ones who were left in that area at
i don’t you say people had fled from the area is that what
yes they fled to zeerust only us who who lost their
why did these people leave go to zeerust
i don’t know the reasons behind their fleeing sir
now i ask whether before this incident your family had been
targeted in any way was there any did any people say that that your
family was in danger because of your son being in the police and your
other son going to school were there any threats made against your
yes we had threats because my child was attending school
whilst the children in the village were boycotting school
and do you know any of the people who made these threats are
you able to identify any of these people 
my child was telling me all those threats but i told her
that she should go to school i would take him very early in the morning
now your son this son who told you about these threats would
he be able to give names do you think would he be able to identify the
no he didn’t tell me names he was just telling me that
people in the village were making threats he was not telling me names
now this mr tiro your neighbour who took you to the hospital
what did he do was he is he a family member
he’s staying at a distance from my house because i knew
that he has a car that he can help me to take me to the hospital
now can you tell us about your daughter who was who was killed
about the circumstances of her death how was she killed and where was
i didn’t see the death of my i didn’t experience the death
of my child after i left the hospital he was stabbed and thrown just
now did the police ever ever investigate this incident did
they come and take statements from you 
yes the police came to take statements from us and i was
unable to go to court because i didn’t know one policeman who one of
those policeman who came to my house
sorry can you repeat that i didn’t understand you said you
couldn’t go to court because you couldn’t identify anybody but what about
this policeman who came to your house you said something about him
i didn’t go to court because i didn’t have any testimony
and the police themselves did they try and investigate this
matter do you have any knowledge of that did they go around
questioning people seeing if there were witnesses trying to find out
yes the police did try to investigate in the village then
people were saying the houses were destroyed by the police if the house
people would say it’s the police who did that so yes the police did
and nothing happened up until today have you heard anything
they they didn’t tell me of their findings but they just
said they were looking for the child for a long time
of the incident you say that there was this conflict between the
anc and you say everybody else who was not a member of the anc was
targeted by the anc can you just 
can you just tell us a little bit about why you say this what
makes you feel this or believe this 
can you please repeat your question sir
what makes you say this you say that anybody who was not a
member of the anc was targeted now why do you make this statement
what was happening that makes you convinced that this is actually what
at the timewere forced to join anc all of us you were
forced to join even if you are a member of the christian democratic
party you were forced to join i had a neighbour whom anc used to go to
but they couldn’t come to my house
you personally were you forced to join the anc 
nobody forced me to join anc
where you a member of any other political party at the time 
believe that was mangope’s party yes 
and people knew this in your village 
were you in any way were you just a member of this party or
were you an official did you have any position in this christian
democratic party or just an ordinary member 
i was just an ordinary member the people in the village
were saying i’m recruiting people for mangope but i was just an ordinary
and were you a member of this party for a long time 
and your son who was at college who was with the boputhatswana
police was he also a member of this party 
i don’t know because everyone went to an organisation of
and now can you tell us what the situation is like in your
village where you live are there still these old tensions and conflicts
of the past or what is actually happening now 
everything is well now in the village even though you’d not
know what’s in the hut of another person but with my observation
i would just appeal to you that maybe your son who was at school
who you said was the one who told you about these threats being made
against the family that if he could maybe assist us if he could make a
statement and maybe if he knew some names which we could follow up on to
try and to to try and get some picture of what was of what was going
on and and perhaps of these thirty people who you mention who came into
your house maybe the identities or names of one or two of them so that
in this way hopefully some answers about what happened to your daughter
	but thank you thank you very much for coming to speak to us about
another side of the conflict which is also very important for us to hear

you said in your village there were people within the anc
organ and you were a member of the christian democratic party were
there members of christian democratic party in your village 
even if there were not many but there were many
when this incident happened to you did it happen to other
people who were members of the christian democratic party
yes there is a certain woman who’s here
can you give us an example 
this woman is my next door neighbour they killed her
child the this woman could have gone to garamka hospital but she’s here
because the truth commission is here that’s the child she was staying
during the school boycotts in your area were members of the
christian democratic party going to school or was your only child going
they were all going to school
but did anything didn’t happen to them
yes it’s only myself and and the woman i’m telling you
mrs sefularo before i come to thank you for coming today
can i just ask your impressions of first of all why were there so many
why were the school boycotts going on in your area at that time why was
there a school boycott in the area
i don’t know the reasons behind the school boycotts
and also could i just come to the question of the anc the
had just been legalised in the rest of the country in boputhatswan if
you remember the government had declared a state of emergency which was
only lifted in march of in fact some of the organisations that were
functioning in the then mmabhata today’s mafeking were demanding for
free political expression to take place in boputhatswana do you remember
any of that at all and your impressions of that as a supporter of mr
i’m not able to tell you anything about mr mangope and his
party and all his political activities because so many things happened
then i don’t want to tell about things which i just heard
i don’t have any other questions is there anything you
would like to say before i finish 
there’s nothing more i want to add sir
mrs sefularo thank you very very much for coming today
for me your story exemplifies what happened in many communities of our
country people in small villages in big towns became divided on the
one side because many of our people were not allowed to express what they
wanted and what they demanded in terms of their political expressions and
on the other side some people who supported a particular movement at
times became targets as well and your daughter like so many other
children in our country became victims a young person of eighteen who
today would have been contributing greatly to the development of this
particular region of our country lost her life and you lost a daughter
and your family your daughters and sons lost a sister we’re very sorry
	we thank you for coming here today and we will come back to you i’m
going to ask for a tea break at this stage but before i do that i just

away when they arrived they said the boy who was here where is he 
then i told them that he has run away whilst you were looking they say

	one of them went to look for a screwdriver in the hippo then opened the
toilet then he said where is he then i told him that he has run away
one of my daughters was hiding in the house then they broke the front
door then they were able to open the kitchen door again they pulled my
daughter after assaulting me they assaulted my daughter then they
dragged us and they were kicking us on the ribs they injured me on the
neck with the back of the gun a certain stout man said to me i should
climb over the hippo then i said do you want me to climb the hippo
take me then he put a bench then he said to me i should climb the
hippo then i was struggling to climb over then he put a hand his hand
his hand was so big i put my toe feet on his hand then i climbed
together with my daughter then whilst i was still in the air he he
threw me inside the hippo therefore he didn’t even say excuse me then
it was myself and my two children
	we the place was crowded they were hitting they were assaulting us
the way they wanted they dislocated my left arm they injured my neck
at the back of my neck then they said my daughter should climb inside
the car boot they beat him with canes when she tried to run away they
would follow her after that a certain boy said kill these people
you’re wasting time if it was myself i could have shot them then they
put us into police vans they took us to motswedi
	they made us to be on a queue and they were assaulting us in whatever
way they took us to the cells they closed the doors we slept in that
in cells at o’clock in the evening they come to interrogate us then
they said what were you arrested for we said to them we don’t know
why were arrested for they took us at o’clock and we didn’t know what
was happening at that time then they asked us who is your chief in this
area i told them that my chief is segobodi then they said you say
segobodi segobodi is normally the chief so they said then i told them
that segobodi is still a chief then the said why don’t you take
boputhatswana id then they said they asked us why are we hating
boputhatswana we told them that we don’t know the purpose of
boputhatswana they said why do you take south african id book we
told them that we grew up in south africa if you say to them your chief
is segobodi they would assault you more and more then they said to us
why don’t you want to take boputhatswana id i told them that i don’t
know whether boputhas is going to be deposed as it is in the morning we
were taken they were pointing us with their guns and then said go and
kill people again if you kill them we’ll come back to you that’s how

were ululating because there is a wedding
what were you several members of any political
organisation or yourself a member of any particular organisation 
where your children members of a political organisation or yourself a
what they came there for was that we you were subjects to

policemen that he was deposed as a chief

was chief segobodi loyal to chief mangope 
no he was denied that people should be amalgamated to
are you related to chief segobodi 
no i’m not related to chief segobodi

miss joyce seroke is going to help you as you tell your
my name my surname is sereko it has been spelt wrongly they
i thought you were my brother we thank you for coming and
we welcome your friend who accompanied you you are coming to tell us of
what has happened on the th of december in lefurutse when you and
jopa ndebele were assaulted by the police we ask you to explain to us
what was happening at that time
may i start in in december there was confusion in our
village we were attacked at night there were knocking at people’s
doors they were taking roofs off the houses we negotiated as the
youth that it’s painful whilst we’re asleep we would hear our neighbour
screaming and we do nothing about it
	it happened that on the th it was on a friday a certain neighbour
was screaming and running towards our house we woke up to see what was
happening we went out to her house we saw a certain man running we
chased him but we couldn’t catch him because it was at night and there
were no lights then on that friday again we agreed that we should
mobilise ourselves to protect our community against the police and even
against those people who are attacking us we did that we as a youth
went to the tribal councillor we asked him to take us to the chief to
explain of what was happening we told him what was happening that
people were disappearing that we as a youth we tried to trace those who
had who have disappeared that tribal councilor explained to us that
he’s experiencing the same thing because he was saying his son has come
back home from his shack house he told us that it is during the night
we cannot go to the chief but he said again that because he’s working
with the chief he would explain to the chief of our problem and again he
allowed us to go on with our work to protect the community 	after that
we went to the village to request the youth all of us agreed mobilised
ourselves and we went to the road to mafeking others on the entrance to
nteqwana others to the road leading to sepere so that we would observe
all cars which are coming inside our village as whether are they were
coming to attack us or are they coming peacefully we who were at the
entrance to zeerust met a hippo then they asked us what we were doing
we were explain to them that we have problems we are protecting our
community because there are people that are attacking us at night those
policemen asked us what authority who gave you the authority to protect
your community we explained to them that the tribal councillor gave us
the go ahead to protect and then again he’s going to meet the chief to
explain him of our problem they asked us about a certain car which has
proceeded towards our direction but we told them that we did not see that
	we patrolled our village the whole night and then in the morning until
in the morning we didn’t see any car coming towards our village the
following day on a saturday we called a meeting of all community
members and to explain to the chief of our problem during that meeting
we explained the problem but adults said to us we are children and we
don’t know anything and we will not achieve everything they told us that
there are police who are doing that work and that work is for the police
only we we could see the attitude of the police that they were not
they were against the idea that we should protect the community but
because the chief and his tribal council agreed with us therefore we
were willing to protect and to help because in many instances we were see
people who left their houses to work their families are not protected
in our discussions with the chief and the community the chief and his
councillors rejected our offer but we told them that we understand what
they’re saying but we said to them we are going to continue with our
work whether you like it or not because we don’t want to hear any
person or we don’t want to see any person being attacked by any people
we don’t know it will be our responsibility to arrest any person who is
attacking anyone who is in our community
	then our chief agreed that he was going to meet chief monamere on the
tuesday to tell them about our problem we told them that it is now
saturday if you’re going to tell us on tuesday if anything happens
during the interim that any person disappears or somebody is killed
whose responsibility is it going to be but we were not answered but
alternately chief and his councillors instructed us that they will
address us on tuesday to tell us of their reply but we told that the
very same day on saturday we will continue with our work during that
night on a saturday we offered that we will patrol our village
	during the night it might be around o’clock we were on the road
towards dinogama a car came towards us and the owner of that car he was
our neighbour and he was a policeman together with his wife we stopped
that car we spoke to the driver we asked him where is he going but he
said to us he’s going to the restaurant but we said for us to believe
that you’re going to the restaurant leave your spare wheel and go with
some of us so as we may certify as whether you are going there or you’re
using this reason as an as an excuse
	after that after some time they came back and we agreed we saw that he
was a visitor and then we saw him that he was innocent a certain car was
owned by mr and mrs legotlo when we looked at that car he was together
with the chief and together with his town council all of them were seven
in that car we asked them where do you come from during this time of
the night they answered that as we said that we’re going to the chief
on tuesday we saw it fit that we should meet the chief now to explain to
him all your problems but we asked them why do you hold this meeting at
night then they said we went at night because we were at work then
now after knocked off we decided that we should go there during the
night we asked them as you are going to the chief were you not at work
but they told us that they wanted to do their tribal responsibilities
first then thereafter they would go to the chief we told them that
because you come from the chief at night you’ll take the responsibly
that those people who are attacking us at night it seems you are the
very same people whom we are looking for
	after we said that some of our group wanted to fight with the chief and
his council but we reprimanded them that these are old people we will
talk with them the following day we stayed there patrolling the village
	then on sunday as i’m a citizen of kutswana that’s staying at the end
of the village in the afternoon of that day whilst i was pre myself to
go to the sports ground the police came and assaulted some of the people
in our village some people were arrested who were selling liquor even
the person who is sitting next to me he since he was beaten from that
sunday our parents supported us and went to the police station to plead
with the police for our release we went to play soccer until late in the
afternoon 	our induna who’s jack tobe came to us and said we should
not patrol on that sunday we should sit down with him and discuss this
problem but we told him that we will talk whilst we are still
patrolling because if you’re going to sit down many things are going to
be wasted he tried to negotiate with us but some of us told him that we
saw the chief in the evening and now we see you again so we don’t want
to see you in the evening that sunday passed by
	on a monday mr isak moloi who is our neighbour who was the police
officer in our local police station came to the village and they were
armed with guns with four cars and one private car their intention was
that they had a list of people who were written on that list and they
were coming to collect those people that appeared on that list
ultimately all of us we were taken by those police cars even if he
didn’t appear on the list but they would make you to go into the car
then they took us to motswedi when we alighted at those police cars we
arrived among the police the police they did torture us at that time
they did to us many things terrible things i don’t believe that if
something can do those things to them they will stand for it they
tortured us from monday tuesday and wednesday they were torturing us
all the time even when they were taking statements from us they were
assaulting us too and forcing us to write what they want us to write not
what we want to write we completed writing those statements on
wednesday but we knew that we were arrested because we were patrolling
but they said we are overthrowing the government
	on tuesday we appeared in court we were prosecuted in court then the
magistrate gave us a free bail we went home at that time on tuesday on
thursday on friday we were taken to dr koch in zeerust and he gave us
medical treatment and gave us medication dr koch gave us a lawyer who’d
defend us in court we had our meeting in wimberbag at the lutheran
church from there we went home after that we started being prosecuted
then up to at the end the case was dismissed because we were not
	then thereafter we talked amongst ourselves knowing that we don’t have
the future for us because we wanted to lay a civil claim against the
police ultimately we didn’t we didn’t have money to go forward with
the civil claim we said because we were not found guilty we’ll try
that all community meetings we should look for authority even if the
chief can write us a letter and call us to his office we will not go
there all of us who were arrested we were twenty one agreed that we
would not go to any tribal meeting we’ll not associate ourselves with
the chief that’s all what i can testify to
	we stayed from up to now some of us are infected with tb’s and we
are affected by many diseases and we are not able to find work because
if you go to slurry our neighbours would say we are the people who are
overthrowing the government therefore there is nowhere where we can be
thank you mr sereko i will ask you two or three questions
you are here to tell us about yourself and jopa ndebele who is your
friend i want to ask you where is jopa ndebele now 
mr jopa ndebele in february he went to a place called
muldersdrift that is where they plant tomatoes his workers came home
but he didn’t we didn’t see
him up to now he’s not at home he went to muldersdrift i don’t know
where this muldersdrift is in the map of south africa
you tell us that there were people who were attacking your
village and people were disappearing who were who were those people who
were attacking your area to the point where you mobilised yourselves to
to tell you the truth we don’t know those people but in terms
of a certain incident the one of our neighbours tried those people
tried to attack those people but the committee members were able to help
those people that is the one who we took against but those who were
but i hope that those people were hired those the time we started to
patrol we were not able to see them because cars were not allowed to
when you say those people were hired to come and attack
your village in your observation were they working for the previous
government or were they just ordinary people 
there was someone i’m respecting his identity who is our
neighbour and he was a member of parliament that’s one of those people
there are other people in our area whom they were giving a hundred rands
or five hundred rands to go and do those things we were not able to
identify those people but i know of one person whom i know who is part
of those group who attacked us
when they were doing these things what was happening in you
community which they disliked to the degree that they hired people to
when these people were doing those things and hiring people
other people were disappearing in your observation those people who were
doing those things what was their objective what was it they didn’t
what they did is what we didn’t like they wanted to enrich
themselves we were agreeing with them but later we said we would not
let people disappear in that way
when you say they were enriching themselves how how did
they enrich themselves what did they do
they wanted to enrich themselves to take people’s parts as
muti to then they would take your parts to and go with them
did you see people who were whose parts were taken or was
it just a rumour or just an allegation that those things were happening 
we didn’t see the victims of those people but because people
from from the vine tree we just heard from the grapevine and then one
child was nearly abducted but our parents took him from one of the
shops it was a boy and a girl whilst they were kidnapped a girl was
able to run away and went to call all people in the village and they were
able to come and free the boy because that is our example that those
apart from taking people’s parts was there a kind of
political activity happening in in your area 
yes there was a certain political activity happening in our
area because in that year in there was an anc organisation which
used to hold meetings in my father’s house it seems they were after anc
members and then they couldn’t find
anc members and we didn’t expose our membership because we were afraid
prison or to be killed but we were anc underground we were anc members
underground that is the first organisation which in our village we were
given advices by african national congress
in anc was not there or was not in public i agree
with you when you say it was operating underground but i want to
understand that when you were patrolling the community were you doing
this with political objective from the anc policy to protect the
we were patrolling to protect the community because the
police were not cooperative with our work and and i’m alone i was
doing the patrol work with political objective because i was seeing that
we were losing our property and ultimately we’re going to disappear and
that’s how we started mobilising ourselves to patrol the community
so the police came there and took you to the police station
yes they were boputhatswana police who were stationed at
who called these police to come to your village to arrest
we don’t have the answer of who called the police but there
was this oneway system which was used by the police to communicate but
we think somebody used that to call the police
you say these police tortured you many things i’d want you
to explain how they tortured you the things which you say you cannot
they were torturing us in many ways as i would say they came
to me and they said they want keys then they pushed me to a corner and
kicked me on my private parts and they mishandles my private parts then
i told them that i don’t have the key which you are looking for we were
made to stand on our head down then they will take your legs and hit them
aganst the wall i was together with my friend whose sitting next to me
his cheek bones were broken they would kicked him on the cheek bones we
had a certain albino then they said do you think albino’s are not
assaulted you will see that we can assault an albino we were assaulted
in different ways after beating us they would make us to exercise in
different ways from there we were taken to the wall they would take a
hosepipe then they would put that hosepipe they will point that
hosepipe to you then they will point it on your eyes we were tortured
is dr koch still available in this area 
we don’t see him anymore in the zeerust hospital we don’t
know where he is now we don’t have the knowledge of his whereabouts as
the lawyer who helped you do you know his whereabouts do
yes i know where he is he’s in tape ended
sitting next to you and give him the name of the doctor and
the lawyer and again the addresses of them both thank you mr sereko
mr sereko do you know of people who actually disappeared
speak about people disappearing from your village 
there’s no one who disappeared because the one who was
supposed to be made to disappear was able to be found
and that the main reason that you started patrolling was to
prevent any future disappearances is that correct 
that’s true that’s true because we were able to rescue
somebody from a shop somebody was supposed to be made to disappear and
was helped by a car from dinoganeng and she was a mess i was not able to
contact myself with him but the first one we were able to meet and i
asked him some questions and told him that you are wanted to appear so as
to expose those people who were making you to disappear but he said to
me he doesn’t care about those things and he’s working he doesn’t want
these people who were thought to be responsible for trying to
abduct people did they come from another village is that what you’re
those people who were abducting our people they are working
together with a certain neighbour of ours we know his house he that
person is staying in our area and that person was dealing with those
and this shop where this person was allegedly found where was
yes it was in our village
now these people that you speak about the neighbour the people
from the other village the people at the shop politically did you
know have any idea of where they where they stood politically what
their political views were who they supported politically is that was
those people were supporters of the christian democratic party
yes i’m definitely sure about it i’m sure about it because
in i’ll put it very straight that that person was a member of
and you believe that these people were assisting in trying to
yes they were helping in abducting the people in our village
but nobody was abducted from your village you said there was an
attempt but the person was found
yes that’s true there was no person who was abducted
that you patrolled your village in order to protect the
community now how did you actually do this you gave us one example of a
car and you stopped the car and you said to the person must leave the
spare tyre behind what else did you do when you were patrolling to
protect the community what kinds of things did you do
we were manning a roadblock at dinokana at the exit to
zeerust we were sleeping in the veld then we’ll put one boy with a
torch when a car approaches he will stop that car after it has
stopped we would come from the veld then we’d count the car then from
there we would go to the car but ultimately firstly is that car which
who whom the the owner gave us the spare wheel and the sadf hippo and
the chief’s car even even in the village we would have people who
who’d patrol and keep on observing all the houses inside to the village
did you ever have an incident where a car refused to stop or
where the people in the car were angry with you for trying to stop them 
no incidents where people refused to stop 
now you say that you were actually charged but you don’t tell
us what what was the charge you went to court and you had a lawyer and
you were charged what was the charge that they laid against you 
we were charged with overthrowing the government we were not
committing sabotage but we patrolling our area because the police were
not coming to protect the our community
the charge that you wanted to overthrow the government is that
what the charge sheet said or did it say something else did it say
public violence perhaps or can you remember 
it was about public violence they were saying we were
where there any did they produce any witnesses did any people
come to court to testify against you 
yes we had witnesses who testified for the state whom we were
meeting with them in the roads during our patrols
what did these witnesses say in court can you give us a can
remember what kind of things were they saying 
the witnesses were testifying about what appeared on the
records by saying we were overthrowing the government
did they accuse you of assault of forcefully stopping people
forcing people to get out of motor cars anything like that 
we were not found guilty during that court case
and did you yourself institute any action against the police who
you say tortured you did you lay a charge against them 
we didn’t lay a charge against the police because what i
would say is that we couldn’t do anything because those people were our
government and we were subjected by their actions
mr sereko just a few brief questions about your own
personal circumstances you were about twenty four years of age when you
were arrested is that correct it was in when it happened 
i i’m not sure how old i was
when did you leave the school 
and what standard did you achieve at that stage 
thank you and are you still working in the mines 
no i’m not working in the mine in the mines i left in 
were you able to work afterwards or did you not find work
i was employed at mosalami game reserve then i was dismissed
because they said i am not wanted because i was the person who was trying
do you have children that you have to care for 
i’ve two children whom i’m taking care of
the first one was born in the second one was born in
the last question is just about your parents are you
parents still living and where do they live 
my parents are still alive they’re staying just at home my
parent is working at the military base in zeerust
while you are unable to work you’ve been dismissed from
the game reserve who looks after you and your children where do you find
my parents take care of me and i’m trying temporary work in
thank you very much that completes my questions
mr seroke just some clarification sereko i just want
clarification you say that you are part of the anc underground the
police when they arrested you and were torturing you in your statement
you said they kept making the comment that we don’t want politicians in
the area and also you were charged with trying to overthrow the
government can you just give us some your own perspective of those
we were just young people who didn’t understand anything for
me to understand is when i met anc people to teach me about my human
rights and about other people’s human rights after that i associated
with the anc’s policies and listened to other youths and respect other
people then i would explain about my association with anc people to the
local youth that we should do the right things our parents in their
committee meetings we as children we were not able to advise the older
people but we we briefed ourselves that we should advise our parents
because our parents are old and they were illiterate ultimately when we
wanted to talk they say we are talking politics at that time we were
not clear what is politics and what is not politics that is then
therefore that our parents said we are politics whilst we were not
agreeing with them that is then that i said we the children can know
thank you mr sereko for coming here today your story is a
